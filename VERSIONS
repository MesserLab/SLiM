VERSION HISTORY

This version history begins with the final release of version 2.0.  Versions prior to 2.0 are lost in the mists of time; since the switch from 1.8 to 2.0 was so large, it was not worth tracking all of the individual changes that were made.

Note that not every commit will be logged here; that is what the Github commit history is for.  The purpose of this file is to record major feature additions, major bug fixes, etc., so that it is easier to track down which version number a particular major change occurred in.  To that end, major changes made in the development head will be logged below; when we decide to roll a new version number and do a new release, all of those development head changes will be reassigned as belonging to the new version number.  We'll see how that goes, and whether I remember to update this file.  :->

The build numbers given here are visible in SLiMgui's about panel.  They are not visible in any way on non-OSX platforms, unfortunately, because they are maintained by a "Run Script" build phase in the Xcode project that places the current git commit count into a field in the Info.plist file of SLiMgui (and EidosScribe).  This mechanism works only on OSX, so the build number is not available on Linux and other platforms.

	move back deployment target from OS X 10.11 to OS X 10.10 thanks to Deploymate
	fix a bug involving calling setValue() inside a for loop, and similar setValue() scenarios involving a changing value

	add a parameter to outputMS() and outputMSSample() to allow only sites that are polymorphic within the sample to be output: filterMonomorphic=T
	fix code completion in SLiMgui after return, in, else, and do

	fix big performance issue for nonWF models as they build up genetic diversity, due to the wrong mutation frequency tallying code path being used
	fix bug EidosSymbolTable buffer overrun in ContainsSymbol() and related methods; this will bite models that define a very large number of symbols (e.g., some nucleotide models)

	fix corrupted spatial location data for some individuals (mostly, maybe only?, first-gen individuals) in .trees files

	fixed a inefficient bottleneck in recipe 13.4 (reading MS format files)
	greatly increase the performance and memory usage of the InteractionType spatial engine for big models (add sparse array for caching pairwise interactions)
		this breaks backward reproducibility in some models, because distances/strengths are now internally rounded to float instead of double
	add interactionDistance() method to InteractionType, returning INF as the distance for non-interacting pairs (including self-self distance)
	add nearestInteractingNeighbors() method to InteractionType, excluding non-interacting pairs from the returned set of neighbors
	add interactingNeighborCount() method to InteractionType, to get a count without getting identities
	changed the semantics of strength(); the first argument must now be a singleton individual, and it returns strengths exerted upon that individual (old semantics were ill-defined and broken for non-reciprocal interactions)
	rememberIndividuals() now actually remembers individuals in the tree sequence, as well as (what it did before) their associated nodes
	fix issues with genome recycling and subpop initialization, which could result in nodes in .trees files being marked as null genomes incorrectly and could cause memory usage to increase without bound
	bug fix: incorrect neutral dynamics for WF models with no non-neutral muttypes, no fitness() callbacks, but using fitnessScaling to modify fitness
	added remembering of the initial generation, to enable recapitation
	change .trees files to have rebased times on write, to simplify pyslim and reduce user error

	switch to using pointers for genomes and individuals
	implement the nonWF generation cycle
	add sampleIndividuals() and subsetIndividuals() methods on Subpopulation for faster fetching of mates, etc.
	add fitnessScaling property to Subpopulation and Individual, to alter fitness values per individual or per-subpop without fitness(NULL) callbacks

	switch to dispatch of properties and methods using std::unordered_map to look up the signature
	miscellaneous other optimizations: "1/relFitness" fitness() callbacks, property return checks, symbol table crossover, std::unordered_map vs. std::map, dynamic_cast<> usage, unnecessary IsNull() calls

	fix InteractionType bug with periodic boundaries and totalOfNeighborStrengths() / strength()
	fix bug where a gene conversion rate of exactly 1.0 would be treated as 0.0
	fix bug with paste of code from a source with unconventional line endings
	add support for a logical argument to mean(), and increase the accuracy of mean() for very large integer vectors by trying to avoid floating-point overflow issues
	fix bug that allowed cachedFitness() to be called from a late() event, returning garbage values
	fix recipe 13.1, which called cachedFitness() during a late() event, which should have been illegal (and now is illegal)
	add recipe 13.3 III, mortality-based fitness using fitnessScaling
	fix a crash when calling setSubpopulationSize(0) (or removeSubpopulation()) twice on the same subpop
	fix searches in the help for strings that return more than one identical hit, such as "tag"; such searches were only displaying one of the multiple hits
	display the emergent selfing rate, cloning rate, and sex ratio in SLiMgui for nonWF models
	make the population visualization graph work better with nonWF models (using fitness values without density scaling, display emergent migration rates)
	make the fitness over time graph display fitness without density scaling, as in other aspects of SLiMgui's presentation of fitness
	fix a crash with the fitness over time graph when the simulation became invalid (due to a stop() call or other error)
	fix a rare crash on quit from SLiMgui
	fix a crash due to stack overflow with large population sizes (only when callbacks are involved in offspring generation)
	add new tree seq stuff: initializeTreeSeq(), treeSeqSimplify(), treeSeqRememberIndividuals(), treeSeqOutput()
	add getwd() / setwd() functions to Eidos
	add var(), cov(), cor() statistics functions to Eidos for variance, covariance, and (Pearson) correlation
	change Eidos to not automatically assume return values based upon the value of the last statement; that makes it confusing/hard to define a function that returns void
	policy change: property/method accesses on zero-length vectors now raise unless the return type of the property/method is unambiguous
	"void" is now an actual value type in Eidos, although it can only be used as a return type for functions/methods; this improves type-safety
	fix recipes: 13.2 (mateChoice() callback with no explicit return), 13.9 (sapply() with no value), 11.2 (cachedFitness() from a late() event)
	add rcauchy() for Cauchy distribution draws, and a "c" Cauchy interaction function option for InteractionType

	add genome1 and genome2 properties on Individual to make getting just the first or second genomes of a vector of individuals simpler, in e.g. haploid models
	add removeMutations(NULL) option that removes all of the mutations from the target genome, for e.g. haploid models; not allowed to be used with substitute=T
	revise recipe 13.13 (modeling haploids) to use genome2 and removeMutations(NULL), making is much faster and simpler
	make the default working directory be ~/Desktop when running in SLiMgui; makes no sense for it to be the folder the app is in
	increase maximum chromosome length from 1e9 to 1e15 (breaks reproducibility from a given seed, due to new MT64 RNG)
	fix rdunif() to be able to generate uniform draws in the full 64-bit range, using the new MT64 RNG; optimize rdunif() and rbinom() for the simple coin-flip case (breaks backward output compatibility)
	fix a crash in SLiMgui when displaying a haplotype plot (including in the chromosome view) in a model with null genomes, such as an X or Y model
	extend containsMarkerMutation() with a [returnMutation=F] argument so the found mutation can be obtained

	add positionsOfMutationsOfType() method to Genome for speed of models that need that
	extend the integer() function to be able to construct vectors of 0 and 1 at specified positions (sort of the opposite of which())
	revise recipe 13.9 to use new vectorized addNewMutation(), as well as the new positionsOfMutationsOfType() and integer()
	fix possible incorrect frequency/count info immediately after using addMutations() or removeMutations() (but not addNewMutation()/addNewDrawnMutation()) – the changes would not be reflected in freqs/counts immediately
	fix a display bug with added (or removed) mutations in SLiMgui
	add "Copy as Paragraph", remove "Paste and Match Style", in SLiMgui and EidosScribe
	fix to only highlight errors in SLiMgui if the script has not changed since the last recycle (otherwise character positions are unreliable)

	add haplotype snapshot plot (create from the Graph pop-up menu or the Simulation menu)
	add haplotype display option for the chromosome view (control-click and select from context menu)

	fix a bug (never released) in pure neutral tracking with addNewMutation(), and optimize pure neutral tracking some more
	add ability to change the number of bins in the frequency spectrum plot

	changed the output format from str() and x.str() to be more R-like
	changed apply() to return a matrix or array in some cases; could break backward compatibility in rare cases
	policy change: assignment into a subset of a property is no longer legal in Eidos (e.g. x.foo[1:3] = rvalue), because it is conceptually flawed (not an lvalue)
	update the GSL code in Eidos to GSL version 2.4 and pulled in gsl_ran_multivariate_gaussian(), gsl_linalg_cholesky_decomp1(), and dependencies (no user-visible impact)
	add rmvnorm() for drawing from a multivariate distribution
	make version() return version numbers to the caller
	extend defineSpatialMap() to allow the map values to be specified as a matrix/array
	internal policy change: properties are no longer allowed to return NULL or be set to NULL, and must raise instead if they cannot provide a value
	policy change: Chromosome properties that used to return NULL when inapplicable now raise (mutation rate map and recombination rate map properties)
	change property semantics: singleton properties accessed on a matrix/array now mirror the dimensional structure of the target, like a unary operator
	rename apply() to sapply() to match R, add a simplify= parameter to govern the result's dimensionality

	fix recipes to use sapply() instead of apply(), following the new function names, and to run in more reasonable time (for testing of them)
	rescale the color scheme for recombination and mutation rate maps in SLiMgui to handle a wider range(1e-6 to 1e-9), and make the mutation rate display with a more purple hue (compared to blue for recombination rate)
	add recipe 13.17 showing a two-trait QTL-based phenotypic model with pleiotropy and nutational correlation, plus live R-based plotting

2.5 (build 1204; Eidos version 1.5):
	add a check for completeness of the help information compared to class definitions, and add doc for a few missing items

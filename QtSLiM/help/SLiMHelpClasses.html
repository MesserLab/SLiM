<p class="p4">The second way to specify the tick set is using the <span class="s1">ticks</span> parameter; this is more flexible but more complicated.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Since script blocks execute across a contiguous span of ticks defined by their <span class="s1">start</span> and <span class="s1">end</span> properties, this may result in the duplication of <span class="s1">block</span>; one script block will be used for each contiguous span of ticks in <span class="s1">ticks</span><span class="s2">.</span><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The <span class="s1">block</span> object itself will be rescheduled to cover the first such span, whereas duplicates of <span class="s1">block</span> will be created to cover subsequent contiguous spans.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A vector containing all of the script blocks scheduled by this method, including <span class="s1">block</span>, will be returned; this vector is guaranteed to be sorted by the (ascending) scheduled execution order of the blocks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Any duplicates of <span class="s1">block</span> created will be given values for the <span class="s1">active</span>, <span class="s1">source</span>, <span class="s1">tag</span>, and <span class="s1">type</span> properties equal to the current values for <span class="s1">block</span>, but will be given an <span class="s1">id</span> of <span class="s1">-1</span> since script block identifiers must be unique; if it is necessary to find the duplicated blocks again later, their <span class="s1">tag</span> property should be used.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The vector supplied for <span class="s1">ticks</span> does not need to be in sorted order, but it must not contain any duplicates.</p>
<p class="p4">Because this method can create a large number of duplicate script blocks, it can sometimes be better to handle script block scheduling in other ways.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If an <span class="s1">early()</span> event needs to execute every tenth tick over the whole duration of a long model run, for example, it would not be advisable to use a call like <span class="s1">community.rescheduleScriptBlock(s1, ticks=seq(10, 100000, 10))</span> for that purpose, since that would result in thousands of duplicate script blocks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Instead, it would be preferable to add a test such as <span class="s1">if (community.tick % 10 != 0) return;</span> at the beginning of the event.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is legal to reschedule a script block while the block is executing; a call like <span class="s1">community.rescheduleScriptBlock(self, community.tick + 10, community.tick + 10);</span> made inside a given block would therefore also cause the block to execute every tenth tick, although this sort of self-rescheduling code is probably harder to read, maintain, and debug.</p>
<p class="p4">Whichever way of specifying the tick set is used, <span class="s1">block</span> may continue to be executed during the current tick cycle stage even after it has been rescheduled, unless it is made inactive using its <span class="s1">active</span> property, and similarly, the block may not execute during the current tick cycle stage if it was not already scheduled to do so.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rescheduling script blocks during the tick and tick cycle stage in which they are executing, or in which they are intended to execute, should be avoided.<span class="s5"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Also, script blocks which are open-ended (i.e., with no specified end tick), are not used in determining whether the end of the simulation has been reached (because then the simulation would run forever); if you reschedule a block to be open-ended, and to start after the end of the last closed-ended block, the rescheduled block will therefore not run at all (just as such a block would not run at all in other circumstances, too).</span></p>
<p class="p4">Note that new script blocks can also be created and scheduled using the <span class="s1">register...()</span> methods of <span class="s1">Community</span> and <span class="s1">Species</span>; by using the same source as a template script block, the template can be duplicated and scheduled for different ticks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, <span class="s1">rescheduleScriptBlock()</span> does essentially that internally.<span class="s5"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In multispecies models, note that all new script blocks created as a side effect of </span><span class="s8">rescheduleScriptBlock()</span><span class="s5"> will have the same </span><span class="s8">species</span><span class="s5"> and </span><span class="s8">ticks</span><span class="s5"> specifier as </span><span class="s8">block</span><span class="s5">; use the </span><span class="s8">register...()</span><span class="s5"> methods to create a new block with a different </span><span class="s8">species</span><span class="s5"> or </span><span class="s8">ticks</span><span class="s5"> specifier.</span></p>

<p class="p6">More specifically, this method uses all available pedigree information from the grandparental and parental pedigree records of <span class="s1">A</span> and <span class="s1">B</span> to compute an estimate of the degree of consanguinity between <span class="s1">A</span> and <span class="s1">B</span>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Siblings have a relatedness of <span class="s1">0.5</span>, as do parents to their children and vice versa; cousins have a relatedness of <span class="s1">0.125</span>; and so forth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If, according to the pedigree information available, <span class="s1">A</span> and <span class="s1">B</span> have no blood relationship, the value returned is <span class="s1">0.0</span>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Note that the value returned by <span class="s1">relatedness()</span> is what is called the “coefficient of relationship” between the two individuals (Wright, 1922; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1086/279872"><span class="s12">https://doi.org/10.1086/279872</span></a>), and ranges from <span class="s1">0.0</span> to <span class="s1">1.0</span>.</p>
<p class="p6">There is another commonly used metric of relatedness, called the “kinship coefficient”, that reflects the probability of identity by descent between two individuals <span class="s1">A</span> and <span class="s1">B</span>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In general, it is approximately equal to one-half of the coefficient of relationship; if an approximate estimate of the kinship coefficient is acceptable, especially in models in which individuals are expected to be outbred, you can simply divide <span class="s1">relatedness()</span> by two.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>However, it should be noted that Wright’s coefficient of relationship is <i>not</i> a measure of the probability of identity by descent, and so it is not exactly double the kinship coefficient; they actually measure different things.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>More precisely, the relationship between them is <span class="s2"><i>r</i> = 2<i>φ</i>/sqrt((1+<i>f</i></span><span class="s13"><sub>A</sub></span><span class="s2">)(1+<i>f</i></span><span class="s13"><sub>B</sub></span><span class="s2">))</span>, where <span class="s2"><i>r</i></span> is Wright’s coefficient of relatedness, <span class="s2"><i>φ</i></span> is the kinship coefficient, and <span class="s2"><i>f</i></span><span class="s13"><sub>A</sub></span> and <span class="s2"><i>f</i></span><span class="s13"><sub>B</sub></span> are the inbreeding coefficients of <span class="s1">A</span> and <span class="s1">B</span> respectively.</p>
<p class="p6">Note that this relatedness is simply pedigree-based relatedness, and does not necessarily correspond to genetic relatedness, because of the effects of factors like assortment and recombination.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If a metric of actual genetic relatedness is desired, tree-sequence recording can be used after simulation is complete, to compute the exact genetic relatedness between individuals based upon the complete ancestry tree (a topic which is beyond the scope of this manual).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Actual genetic relatedness cannot presently be calculated during a simulation run; the information is implicitly contained in the recorded tree-sequence tables, but calculating it is too computationally expensive to be reasonable.</p>
<p class="p6">This method assumes that the grandparents (or the parents, if grandparental information is not available) are themselves unrelated and that they are not inbred; this assumption is necessary because we have no information about their parentage, since SLiM’s pedigree tracking information only goes back two generations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Be aware that in a model where inbreeding or selfing occurs at all (including “incidental selfing”, where a hermaphroditic individual happens to choose itself as a mate), some level of “background relatedness” will be present and this assumption will be violated.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In such circumstances, <span class="s1">relatedness()</span> will therefore tend to underestimate the degree of relatedness between individuals, and the greater the degree of inbreeding, the greater the underestimation will be.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If inbreeding is allowed in a model – and particularly if it is common – the results of <span class="s1">relatedness()</span> should therefore not be taken as an estimate of <i>absolute</i> relatedness, but can still be useful as an estimate of <i>relative</i> relatedness (indicating that, say, A appears from the information available to be more closely related to B than it is to C).</p>

<p class="p6">Beginning in SLiM 4.1, this method has a vectorized mode of operation in which the <span class="s1">receiver</span> parameter may be non-singleton.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To switch the method to this mode, pass <span class="s1">T</span> for <span class="s1">returnDict</span>, rather than the default of <span class="s1">F</span> (the operation of which is described above).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In this mode, the return value is a <span class="s1">Dictionary</span> object instead of a vector of <span class="s1">Individual</span> objects.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This dictionary uses <span class="s1">integer</span> keys that range from <span class="s1">0</span> to <span class="s1">N-1</span>, where <span class="s1">N</span> is the number of individuals passed in <span class="s1">receiver</span>; these keys thus correspond directly to the indices of the individuals in <span class="s1">receiver</span>, and there is one entry in the dictionary for each receiver.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The value in the dictionary, for a given <span class="s1">integer</span> key, is an <span class="s1">object&lt;Individual&gt;</span> vector with the individuals drawn for the corresponding receiver, exactly as described above for the non-vectorized case.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The results for each receiver can therefore be obtained from the returned dictionary with <span class="s1">getValue()</span>, passing the index of the receiver.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The speed of this mode of operation will probably be similar to the speed of making <span class="s1">N</span> separate non-vectorized calls to <span class="s1">drawByStrength()</span>, when running single-threaded.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When running multi-threaded, however, a substantial performance improvement may be realized by using the vectorized version of this method, since the queries can then be executed in parallel.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In this mode of operation, all receivers must belong to the same subpopulation.</p>
<p class="p3">– (void)evaluate(io&lt;Subpopulation&gt; subpops)</p>

<p class="p6">You must explicitly call <span class="s1">evaluate()</span> at an appropriate time in the tick cycle before the interaction is used, but after any relevant changes have been made to the population.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>SLiM will invalidate any existing interactions after any portion of the tick cycle in which new individuals have been born or existing individuals have died.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In a WF model, this occurs just before <span class="s1">late()</span> events execute (see the WF tick cycle diagram in chapter 23), so <span class="s1">late()</span> events are often the appropriate place to put <span class="s1">evaluate()</span> calls, but <span class="s1">first()</span> or <span class="s1">early()</span> events can work too if the interaction is not needed until that point in the tick cycle anyway. In nonWF models, on the other hand, new offspring are produced just before <span class="s1">early()</span> events and then individuals die just before <span class="s1">late()</span> events (see the nonWF tick cycle diagram in chapter 24), so interactions will be invalidated twice during each tick cycle.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This means that in a nonWF model, an interaction that influences reproduction should usually be evaluated in a <span class="s1">first()</span> event, while an interaction that influences fitness or mortality should usually be evaluated in an <span class="s1">early()</span> event (and an interaction that affects both may need to be evaluated at both times).</p>
<p class="p6">If an interaction is never evaluated for a given subpopulation, it is guaranteed that there will be essentially no memory or computational overhead associated with the interaction for that subpopulation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Furthermore, attempting to query an interaction for a receiver or exerter in a subpopulation that has not been evaluated is guaranteed to raise an error.</p>

<p class="p6">This method is similar to <span class="s1">nearestInteractingNeighbors()</span> (when passed a large count so as to guarantee that all interacting individuals are returned), but this method returns only a count of the interacting individuals, not a vector containing the individuals.</p>

<p class="p6">To calculate the clipped integral of the interaction function, this method uses the same numerical estimator used by the <span class="s1">clippedIntegral()</span> method of <span class="s1">InteractionType</span>, and all of the caveats described for that method apply here also; notably, all individuals must be within spatial bounds, the maximum interaction distance must be less than half the spatial extent of the subpopulation, and <span class="s1">interaction()</span> callbacks are not used (and so, for this method, are not allowed to be active).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>See the documentation for <span class="s1">clippedIntegral()</span> for further discussion of the details of these calculations.</p>

<p class="p6">To see the point of this method, consider a receiver located near the edge of the spatial bounds of its subpopulation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some portion of the interaction function that surrounds that receiver falls outside the spatial bounds of its subpopulation, and will therefore never contain an interacting exerter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If, for example, interaction strengths are used as a measure of competition, this receiver will therefore have an advantage, because it will never feel any competition from the portion of its range that falls outside spatial bounds.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>However, that portion of its range is presumably also not available to the receiver itself, for foraging or hunting, in which case this advantage is not biologically realistic, but is instead just an undesirable “edge effect” artifact.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dividing by the integral of the interaction function, clipped to the spatial bounds, provides a way to compensate for this edge effect.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A nice side effect of using local population densities instead of total interaction strengths is that the maximum interaction strength passed to <span class="s1">setInteractionFunction()</span> no longer matters; it cancels out when the total interaction strength is divided by the receiver’s clipped integral.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>However, the <i>shape</i> of the interaction function does still matter; it determines the relative weights used for exerters at different distances from the position of the receiver.</p>

<p class="p6">If the strengths of interactions exerted by a single individual upon multiple individuals are needed instead (the inverse of what this method provides), multiple calls to this method will be necessary, one per pairwise interaction queried; the interaction engine is not optimized for the inverse case, and so it will likely be quite slow to compute.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If the interaction is reciprocal and has the same receiver and exerter constraints, the opposite query should provide identical results in a single efficient call (because then the interactions exerted are equal to the interactions received); otherwise, the best approach might be to define a second interaction type representing the inverse interaction that you wish to be able to query efficiently.</p>

<p class="p6">This method can be useful for narrowing a vector of individuals down to just those that satisfy constraints.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Outside the context of <span class="s1">InteractionType</span>, similar functionality is provided by the <span class="s1">Subpopulation</span> method <span class="s1">subsetIndividuals()</span>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Note that the use of <span class="s1">testConstraints()</span> is somewhat rare; usually, queries are evaluated across a vector of individuals, each of which might or might not satisfy the defined constraints.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Individuals that do not satisfy constraints do not participate in interactions, so their interaction strength with other individuals will simply be zero.</p>
<p class="p6">See the <span class="s1">setConstraints()</span> method to set up constraints, as well as the <span class="s1">sexSegregation</span> parameter to <span class="s1">initializeInteractionType()</span>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Note that if the constraints tested involve <span class="s1">tag</span> values (including <span class="s1">tagL0</span> / <span class="s1">tagL1</span> / <span class="s1">tagL2</span> / <span class="s1">tagL3</span> / <span class="s1">tagL4</span>), the corresponding property or properties of the tested individuals must be defined (i.e., must have been set to a value), or an error will result because the constraints cannot be applied.</p>
<p class="p5">– (float)totalOfNeighborStrengths(object&lt;Individual&gt; receivers, [No&lt;Subpopulation&gt;$ exerterSubpop = NULL])</p>

<p class="p6">For one individual, this is essentially the same as calling <span class="s1">nearestInteractingNeighbors()</span> with a large <span class="s1">count</span> so as to obtain the complete vector of all interacting neighbors, calling <span class="s1">strength()</span> for each of those interactions to get each interaction strength, and adding those interaction strengths together with <span class="s1">sum()</span>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This method is much faster than that implementation, however, since all of that work is done as a single operation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Also, <span class="s1">totalOfNeighborStrengths()</span> can total up interactions for more than one receiver in a single vectorized call.</p>
<p class="p6">Similarly, for one individual this is essentially the same as calling <span class="s1">strength()</span> to get the interaction strengths between a receiver and all individuals in the exerter subpopulation, and then calling <span class="s1">sum()</span>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Again, this method should be much faster, since this algorithm looks only at neighbors, whereas calling <span class="s1">strength()</span> directly assesses interaction strengths with all other individuals.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This will make a particularly large difference when the subpopulation size is large and the maximum distance of the <span class="s1">InteractionType</span> is small.</p>
<p class="p6">See <span class="s1">localPopulationDensity()</span> for a related method that calculates the total interaction strength divided by the amount of “interaction field” present for an individual (i.e., the integral of the interaction function clipped to the spatial bounds of the subpopulation) to provide an estimate of the “interaction density” felt by an individual.</p>

<p class="p6">Discards all evaluation of this interaction, for all subpopulations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The state of the <span class="s1">InteractionType</span> is reset to a state prior to evaluation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This can be useful if the model state has changed in such a way that the evaluation already conducted is no longer valid.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For example, if the maximum distance, the interaction function, or the receiver or exerter constraints of the <span class="s1">InteractionType</span> need to be changed with immediate effect, or if the data used by an <span class="s1">interaction()</span> callback has changed in such a way that previously calculated interaction strengths are no longer correct, <span class="s1">unevaluate()</span> allows the interaction to begin again from scratch.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">In WF models, all interactions are automatically reset to an unevaluated state at the moment when the new offspring generation becomes the parental generation (at step 4 in the tick cycle).</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">In nonWF models, all interactions are automatically reset to an unevaluated state twice per tick: immediately after </span><span class="s4">reproduction()</span><span class="s3"> callbacks have completed (after step 1 in the tick cycle), and immediately before viability/survival selection (before step 4 in the tick cycle).</span></p>

<p class="p6">Only in nonWF models, the <span class="s1">haploid</span> parameter may be <span class="s1">T</span>; in this case, the second genome of each new individual will be a null genome, rather than an empty genome.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For even greater control in nonWF models, you can call <span class="s1">addSubpop()</span> with an initial size of <span class="s1">0</span> and then stock the population with new individuals created however you wish in the next tick’s <span class="s1">reproduction()</span> callback.</p>

<p class="p6">Immediately kills the individuals in <span class="s1">individuals</span>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This removes them from their subpopulation and gives them an <span class="s1">index</span> value of <span class="s1">-1</span>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The <span class="s1">Individual</span> objects are not freed immediately, since references to them could still exist in local Eidos variables; instead, the individuals are kept in a temporary “graveyard” until they can be freed safely.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It therefore continues to be safe to use them and their genomes, except that accessing their <span class="s1">subpopulation</span> property will raise an error since they no longer have a subpopulation.</p>
<p class="p6">Note that the indices and order of individuals and genomes in all source subpopulations will change unpredictably as a side effect of this method.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All evaluated interactions are invalidated as a side effect of calling this method.</p>
<p class="p6">Note that this method is only for use in nonWF models, in which mortality is managed manually by the model script.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In WF models, mortality is managed automatically by the SLiM core when the new offspring generation becomes the parental generation and the previous parental generation dies; mortality does not otherwise occur in WF models.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In nonWF models, mortality normally occurs during the survival stage of the tick cycle, based upon the fitness values calculated by SLiM, and <span class="s1">survival()</span> callbacks can influence the outcome of that survival stage.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Calls to <span class="s1">killIndividuals()</span>, on the other hand, can be made at any time during <span class="s1">first()</span>, <span class="s1">early()</span>, or <span class="s1">late()</span> events, and the result cannot be modified by <span class="s1">survival()</span> callbacks; the given individuals are simply immediately killed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This method therefore provides an alternative, and relatively rarely used, mortality mechanism that is disconnected from fitness.</p>

<p class="p6"><span class="s3">As of SLiM 3.0, this method will read and restore the ages of individuals if that information is present in the output file and the simulation is based upon the nonWF model.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If ages are present but the simulation uses a WF model, an error will result; the WF model does not use age information.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If ages are not present but the simulation uses a nonWF model, an error will also result; the nonWF model requires age information.</span></p>

<p class="p6">This method can also be used to read tree-sequence (<span class="s1">.trees</span>) files saved by <span class="s1">treeSeqOutput()</span> or generated by the Python <span class="s1">pyslim</span> package.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Note that the user metadata for a tree-sequence file can be read separately with the <span class="s1">treeSeqMetadata()</span> function.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Beginning with SLiM 4, the <span class="s1">subpopMap</span> parameter may be supplied to re-order the populations of the input tree sequence when it is loaded in to SLiM.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This parameter must have a value that is a <span class="s1">Dictionary</span>; the keys of this dictionary should be SLiM population identifiers as <span class="s1">string</span> values (e.g., <span class="s1">"p2"</span>), and the values should be indexes of populations in the input tree sequence; a key/value pair of <span class="s1">"p2", 4</span> would mean that the fifth population in the input (the one at zero-based index <span class="s1">4</span>) should become <span class="s1">p2</span> on loading into SLiM.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If <span class="s1">subpopMap</span> is non-<span class="s1">NULL</span>, <i>all</i> populations in the tree sequence must be explicitly mapped, even if their index will not change and even if they will not be used by SLiM; the only exception is for unused slots in the population table, which can be explicitly remapped but do not have to be.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For instance, suppose we have a tree sequence in which population <span class="s1">0</span> is unused, population <span class="s1">1</span> is not a SLiM population (for example, an ancestral population produced by <span class="s1">msprime</span>), and population 2 is a SLiM population, and we want to load this in with population 2 as <span class="s1">p0</span> in SLiM.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To do this, we could supply a value of <span class="s1">Dictionary("p0", 2, "p1", 1, "p2", 0)</span> for <span class="s1">subpopMap</span>, or we could leave out slot <span class="s1">0</span> since it is unused, with <span class="s1">Dictionary("p0", 2, "p1", 1)</span>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although this facility cannot be used to remove populations in the tree sequence, note that it may <i>add</i> populations that will be visible when <span class="s1">treeSeqOutput()</span> is called (although these will not be SLiM populations); if, in this example, we had used <span class="s1">Dictionary("p0", 0, "p1", 1, "p5", 2)</span> and then we wrote the result out with <span class="s1">treeSeqOutput()</span>, the resulting tree sequence would have six populations, although three of them would be empty and would not be used by SLiM.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The use of <span class="s1">subpopMap</span> makes it easier to load simulation data that was generated in Python, since that typically uses an id of <span class="s1">0</span>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The <span class="s1">subpopMap</span> parameter may not be used with file formats other than tree-sequence files, at the present time; setting up the correct subpopulation ids is typically easier when working with those other formats.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Note the <span class="s1">tskit</span> command-line interface can be used, like <span class="s1">python3 -m tskit populations file.trees</span>, to find out the number of subpopulations in a tree-sequence file and their IDs.</p>
<p class="p6">When loading a tree sequence, a crosscheck of the loaded data will be performed to ensure that the tree sequence was well-formed and was loaded correctly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When running a Release build of SLiM, however, this crosscheck will only occur the first time that <span class="s1">readFromPopulationFile()</span> is called to load a tree sequence; subsequent calls will not perform this crosscheck, for greater speed when running models that load saved population state many times (such as models that are conditional on fixation).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you suspect that a tree sequence file might be corrupted or read incorrectly, running a Debug build of SLiM enables crosschecks after every load.</p>

<p class="p6">Force an immediate recalculation of fitness values for all individuals in all subpopulations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Normally fitness values are calculated at a fixed point in each tick, and those values are cached and used until the next recalculation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If simulation parameters are changed in script in a way that affects fitness calculations, and if you wish those changes to take effect immediately rather than taking effect at the next automatic recalculation, you may call <span class="s1">recalculateFitness()</span> to force an immediate recalculation and recache.</p>
<p class="p6">The optional parameter <span class="s1">tick</span> provides the tick for which <span class="s1">mutationEffect()</span> and <span class="s1">fitnessEffect()</span> callbacks should be selected; if it is <span class="s1">NULL</span> (the default), the current tick value for the simulation, <span class="s1">community.tick</span>, is used.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you call <span class="s1">recalculateFitness()</span> in an <span class="s1">early()</span> event in a WF model, you may wish this to be <span class="s1">community.tick - 1</span> in order to utilize the <span class="s1">mutationEffect()</span> and <span class="s1">fitnessEffect()</span> callbacks for the previous tick, as if the changes that you have made to fitness-influencing parameters were already in effect at the end of the previous tick when the new generation was first created and evaluated (usually it is simpler to just make such changes in a <span class="s1">late()</span> event instead, however, in which case calling <span class="s1">recalculateFitness()</span> is probably not necessary at all since fitness values will be recalculated immediately afterwards).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Regardless of the value supplied for <span class="s1">tick</span> here, <span class="s1">community.tick</span> inside callbacks will report the true tick number, so if your callbacks consult that parameter in order to create tick-specific fitness effects you will need to handle the discrepancy somehow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(Similar considerations apply for nonWF models that call <span class="s1">recalculateFitness()</span> in a <span class="s1">late()</span> event, which is also not advisable in general.)</p>
<p class="p6">After this call, the fitness values used for all purposes in SLiM will be the newly calculated values.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Calling this method will trigger the calling of any enabled and applicable <span class="s1">mutationEffect()</span> and <span class="s1">fitnessEffect()</span> callbacks, so this is quite a heavyweight operation; you should think carefully about what side effects might result (which is why fitness recalculation does not just occur automatically after changes that might affect fitness values).</p>

<p class="p6">There are two ways to keep individuals across simplification.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If <span class="s1">permanent</span> is <span class="s1">T</span> (the default), then the specified individuals will be permanently remembered: their genomes will be added to the current sample, and they will always be present in the tree sequence.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Permanently remembering a large number of individuals will, of course, markedly increase memory usage and runtime.</p>
<p class="p6">Supplying <span class="s1">F</span> for <span class="s1">permanent</span> will instead mark the individuals only for (temporary) retention: their genomes will not be added to the sample, and they will appear in the final tree sequence only if one of their genomes is retained across simplification.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In other words, the rule of thumb for retained individuals is simple: if a genome is kept by simplification, the genome’s corresponding individual is kept also, <i>if</i> it is retained.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Note that permanent remembering takes priority; calling this function with <span class="s1">permanent=F</span> on an individual that has previously been permanently remembered will not remove it from the sample.</p>

<p class="p6">Beginning in SLiM 3.5, the <span class="s1">values</span> parameter must be a vector/matrix/array with the number of dimensions appropriate for the declared spatiality of the map; for example, a map with spatiality <span class="s1">"x"</span> would require a (one-dimensional) vector, spatiality <span class="s1">"xy"</span> would require a (two-dimensional) matrix, and a map with spatiality of <span class="s1">"xyz"</span> would require a three-dimensional array.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(See the Eidos manual for discussion of vectors, matrices, and arrays.)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The data in <span class="s1">values</span> is interpreted in such a way that a two-dimensional matrix of values, with (0, 0) at upper left and values by column, is transformed into the format expected by SLiM, with (0, 0) at lower left and values by row; in other words, the two-dimensional matrix as it prints in the Eidos console will match the appearance of the two-dimensional spatial map as seen in SLiMgui.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span><i>This is a change in behavior from versions prior to SLiM 3.5</i>; it ensures that images loaded from disk with the Eidos class <span class="s1">Image</span> can be used directly as spatial maps, achieving the expected orientation, with no need for transposition or flipping.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If the spatial map is a three-dimensional array, it is read as successive <i>z</i>-axis “planes”, each of which is a two-dimensional matrix that is treated as described above.</p>
<p class="p6">Moving on to the other parameters of <span class="s1">defineSpatialMap()</span>: if <span class="s1">interpolate</span> is <span class="s1">F</span>, values across the spatial map are not interpolated; the value at a given point is equal to the nearest value defined by the grid of values specified.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If <span class="s1">interpolate</span> is <span class="s1">T</span>, values across the spatial map will be interpolated (using linear, bilinear, or trilinear interpolation as appropriate) to produce spatially continuous variation in values.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In either case, the corners of the value grid are exactly aligned with the corners of the spatial boundaries of the subpopulation as specified by <span class="s1">setSpatialBounds()</span>, and the value grid is then stretched across the spatial extent of the subpopulation in such a manner as to produce equal spacing between the values along each dimension.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The setting of <span class="s1">interpolation</span> only affects how values between these grid points are calculated: by nearest-neighbor, or by linear interpolation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Interpolation of spatial maps with periodic boundaries is not handled specially; to ensure that the edges of a periodic spatial map join smoothly, simply ensure that the grid values at the edges of the map are identical, since they will be coincident after periodic wrapping.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Note that cubic/bicubic interpolation is generally smoother than linear/bilinear interpolation, with fewer artifacts, but it is substantially slower to calculate; use the <span class="s1">interpolate()</span> method of <span class="s1">SpatialMap</span> to precalculate an interpolated map using cubic/bucubic interpolation.</p>
<p class="p6">The <span class="s1">valueRange</span> and <span class="s1">colors</span> parameters travel together; either both are unspecified, or both are specified.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They control how map values will be transformed into colors, by SLiMgui and by the <span class="s1">mapColor()</span> method.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The <span class="s1">valueRange</span> parameter establishes the color-mapped range of spatial map values, as a vector of length two specifying a minimum and maximum; this does not need to match the actual range of values in the map.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The <span class="s1">colors</span> parameter then establishes the corresponding colors for values within the interval defined by <span class="s1">valueRange</span>: values less than or equal to <span class="s1">valueRange[0]</span> will map to <span class="s1">colors[0]</span>, values greater than or equal to <span class="s1">valueRange[1]</span> will map to the last <span class="s1">colors</span> value, and intermediate values will shade continuously through the specified vector of colors, with interpolation between adjacent colors to produce a continuous spectrum.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is much simpler than it sounds in this description; see the recipes in chapter 15 for an illustration of its use.</p>
<p class="p6">Note that at present, SLiMgui will only display spatial maps of spatiality <span class="s1">"x"</span>, <span class="s1">"y"</span>, or <span class="s1">"xy"</span>; the color-mapping parameters will simply be ignored by SLiMgui for other spatiality values (even if the spatiality is a superset of these values; SLiMgui will not attempt to display an <span class="s1">"xyz"</span> spatial map, for example, since it has no way to choose which 2D slice through the <i>xyz</i> space it ought to display).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The <span class="s1">mapColor()</span> method will return translated color strings for any spatial map, however, even if SLiMgui is unable to display the spatial map.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If there are multiple spatial maps that SLiMgui is capable of displaying, it choose one for display by default, but other maps may be selected from the action menu on the individuals view (by clicking on the button with the gear icon).</p>

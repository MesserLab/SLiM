<p class="p3">mutationStackPolicy &lt;–&gt; (string$)</p>
<p class="p4">This property and the <span class="s1">mutationStackGroup</span> property together govern whether mutations of this mutation type’s stacking group can “stack” – can occupy the same position in a single individual.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A set of mutation types with the same value for <span class="s1">mutationStackGroup</span> is called a “stacking group”, and all mutation types in a given stacking group must have the same <span class="s1">mutationStackPolicy</span> value, which defines the stacking behavior of all mutations of the mutation types in the stacking group.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In other words, one stacking group might allow its mutations to stack, while another stacking group might not, but the policy within each stacking group must be unambiguous.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">This property is </span><span class="s4">"s"</span><span class="s3"> by default, indicating that mutations in this stacking group should be allowed to stack without restriction.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If the policy is set to </span><span class="s4">"f"</span><span class="s3">, the <i>first</i> mutation of stacking group at a given site is retained; further mutations of this stacking group at the same site are discarded with no effect.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This can be useful for modeling one-way changes; once a gene is disabled by a premature stop codon, for example, you might wish to assume, for simplicity, that further mutations cannot alter that fact.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If the policy is set to </span><span class="s4">"l"</span><span class="s3">, the <i>last</i> mutation of this stacking group at a given site is retained; earlier mutation of this stacking group at the same site are discarded.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This can be useful for modeling an “infinite-alleles” scenario in which every new mutation at a site generates a completely new allele, rather than retaining the previous mutations at the site.</span></p>
<p class="p4">The mutation stacking policy applies only within the given mutation type’s stacking group; mutations of different stacking groups are always allowed to stack in SLiM.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The policy applies to all mutations added to the model after the policy is set, whether those mutations are introduced by calls such as <span class="s1">addMutation()</span>, <span class="s1">addNewMutation()</span>, or <span class="s1">addNewDrawnMutation()</span>, or are added by SLiM’s own mutation-generation machinery.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>However, no attempt is made to enforce the policy for mutations already existing at the time the policy is set; typically, therefore, the policy is set in an <span class="s1">initialize()</span> callback so that it applies throughout the simulation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The policy is also not enforced upon the mutations loaded from a file with <span class="s1">readFromPopulationFile()</span>; such mutations were governed by whatever stacking policy was in effect when the population file was generated.</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s3">In nucleotide-based models, the stacking policy for nucleotide-based mutation types is always </span><span class="s4">"l"</span><span class="s3">, and cannot be changed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This ensures that new nucleotide mutations always replace the previous nucleotide at a site, and that more than one nucleotide mutation is never present at the same position in a single genome.</span></p>

<p class="p4">Reschedule the target script block given by <span class="s1">block</span> to execute in a specified set of generations.</p>
<p class="p4">The first way to specify the generation set is with <span class="s1">start</span> and <span class="s1">end</span> parameter values; <span class="s1">block</span> will then execute from <span class="s1">start</span> to <span class="s1">end</span>, inclusive.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In this case, <span class="s1">block</span> is returned.</p>
<p class="p4">The second way to specify the generation set is using the <span class="s1">generations</span> parameter; this is more flexible but more complicated.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Since script blocks execute across a contiguous span of generations defined by their <span class="s1">start</span> and <span class="s1">end</span> properties, this may result in the duplication of <span class="s1">block</span>; one script block will be used for each contiguous span of generations in <span class="s1">generations</span><span class="s2">.</span><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The <span class="s1">block</span> object itself will be rescheduled to cover the first such span, whereas duplicates of <span class="s1">block</span> will be created to cover subsequent contiguous spans.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A vector containing all of the script blocks scheduled by this method, including <span class="s1">block</span>, will be returned; this vector is guaranteed to be sorted by the (ascending) scheduled execution order of the blocks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Any duplicates of <span class="s1">block</span> created will be given values for the <span class="s1">active</span>, <span class="s1">source</span>, <span class="s1">tag</span>, and <span class="s1">type</span> properties equal to the current values for <span class="s1">block</span>, but will be given an <span class="s1">id</span> of <span class="s1">-1</span> since script block identifiers must be unique; if it is necessary to find the duplicated blocks again later, their <span class="s1">tag</span> property should be used.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The vector supplied for <span class="s1">generations</span> does not need to be in sorted order, but it must not contain any duplicates.</p>
<p class="p4">Because this method can create a large number of duplicate script blocks, it can sometimes be better to handle script block scheduling in other ways.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If an <span class="s1">early()</span> event needs to execute every tenth generation over the whole duration of a long model run, for example, it would not be advisable to use a call like <span class="s1">sim.rescheduleScriptBlock(s1, generations=seq(10, 100000, 10))</span> for that purpose, since that would result in thousands of duplicate script blocks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Instead, it would be preferable to add a test such as <span class="s1">if (sim.generation % 10 != 0) return;</span> at the beginning of the event.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is legal to reschedule a script block while the block is executing; a call like <span class="s1">sim.rescheduleScriptBlock(self, sim.generation + 10, sim.generation + 10);</span> made inside a given block would therefore also cause the block to execute every tenth generation, although this sort of self-rescheduling code is probably harder to read, maintain, and debug.</p>
<p class="p4">Whichever way of specifying the generation set is used, <span class="s1">block</span> may continue to be executed during the current life cycle stage even after it has been rescheduled, unless it is made inactive using its <span class="s1">active</span> property, and similarly, the block may not execute during the current life cycle stage if it was not already scheduled to do so.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rescheduling script blocks during the generation and life cycle stage in which they are executing, or in which they are intended to execute, should be avoided.</p>
<p class="p4">Note that new script blocks can also be created and scheduled using the <span class="s1">register...()</span> methods of <span class="s1">SLiMSim</span>; by using the same source as a template script block, the template can be duplicated and scheduled for different generations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, <span class="s1">rescheduleScriptBlock()</span> does essentially that internally.</p>

// We want to keep a history of frequency values for each mutation of the chosen mutation type in the
// chosen subpopulation.  The history of a mutation should persist after it has vanished, and if a
// new mutation object gets allocated at the same memory location, it should be treated as a distinct
// mutation; so we can't use pointers to identify mutations.  Instead, we keep data on them using a
// unique 64-bit ID generated only when SLiM is running under SLiMgui.  At the end of a generation,
// we loop through all mutations in the registry, and add an entry for that mutation in our data store.
// This is probably O(n^2), but so it goes.  It should only be used for mutation types that generate
// few mutations; if somebody tries to plot every mutation in a common mutation-type, they will suffer.

 EidosConsoleTextView provides a standard Eidos console textview.  It is integrated into EidosConsoleWindowController,
 so if you use that class you get a console textview for free, and do not have to use this class directly.  If you
 build your own Eidos UI, you might wish to use this class to provide a console.

// A delegate for Eidos functionality; this is the same object as the NSText/NSTextView delegate, and is not declared explicitly
// here because overriding properties with a different type doesn't really work.  So when you call setDelegate: on EidosTextView,
// you will not get the proper type-checking, and you will get a runtime error if your delegate object does not in fact conform
// to the EidosTextViewDelegate protocol.  But if you declare your conformance to the protocol, you should be fine.  This is a
// little weird, but the only good alternative is to have a separate delegate object for Eidos, which would just be annoying and
// confusing.

// This adds a command to the console window's history; it should be called to register all commands executed
// in the console, including commands sent to the delegate to execute by -eidosConsoleTextViewExecuteInput:,
// since the console does not assume that that call results in successful execution.

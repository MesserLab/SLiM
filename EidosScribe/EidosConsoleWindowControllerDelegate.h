 This is an Objective-C++ header, and so can only be included by Objective-C++ compilations (.mm files instead of .m files).
 You should not need to include this header in your .h files, since you can declare protocol conformance in a class-continuation
 category in your .m file, so only classes that conform to this protocol should need to be Objective-C++.
 
 EidosConsoleWindowControllerDelegate is a protocol of optional methods that EidosConsoleWindowController's delegate can
 implement, to provide various Context-defined behaviors and modifications.

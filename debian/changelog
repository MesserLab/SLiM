slimsim (3.7-7) focal; urgency=medium

  * Seventh release (3.7-7)
  Removed all version requirements in Depends field of debian/control,
  as the minimum version of Qt5 required is about 5.9 and all versions
  of Debian and Ubuntu should have sufficient library versions
  available.

 -- Bryce Carson <bcars268@mtroyal.ca>  Wed, 09 Feb 2022 12:46:24 -0700

slimsim (3.7-6) focal; urgency=medium

  * Sixth release (3.7-6)
  Added `dh-exec` to the Build-Depends to provide
  /usr/share/perl5/Debian/Dh_Lib.pm which is required for debhelper to
  use the "file => new_filename" installation scheme in
  ~debian/package.install~.

slimsim (3.7-5) focal; urgency=medium

  * Fifth release (3.7-5)

 -- Bryce Carson <bcars268@mtroyal.ca>  Wed, 09 Feb 2022 00:27:04 -0700

slimsim (3.7-4) xenial; urgency=medium

  * Fourth release (3.7-4)
  Added `debhelper` (without a version specification) to the
  Build-Depends field because the `dh` command cannot be found on the
  builder at Launchpad.

 -- Bryce Carson <bcars268@mtroyal.ca>  Wed, 09 Feb 2022 00:18:17 -0700

slimsim (3.7-3) xenial; urgency=medium

  * Third release (3.7-3)
  Removed the "Rules-requires-root" field from the source paragraph of
  the debian/control file. The poor state of Debian packaging documen-
  tation led me to think this was somehow necessary. Oh well. One step
  at a time towards successful builds!

 -- Bryce Carson <bcars268@mtroyal.ca>  Wed, 09 Feb 2022 00:03:47 -0700

slimsim (3.7-2) xenial; urgency=medium

  * Second release (3.7-2)
  Removed debhelper and debhelper-compat entries in build dependencies.
  Instead, a debian/compat file is now used. Hopefully this resolves
  the build issues on Launchpad.net.

 -- Bryce Carson <bcars268@mtroyal.ca>  Tue, 08 Feb 2022 23:45:13 -0700

slimsim (3.7-1) xenial; urgency=medium

  * Initial release (3.7-1)
  SLiM with SLiMgui packaged as slimsim for Debian and Ubuntu. The use
  of lintian will complain about the metadata license for the appstream
  XML, (possible) spelling errors in the binaries, the use of first
  person grammar in the Description field of the debian/control file, 
  and static linkage to ZLIB and (customized) GSL, which is not
  addressed in this packaging effort.

\pard\pardeftab397\li547\ri720\sb60\sa60\partightenfactor0

\f4\fs20 \cf0 The color used to display substitutions in SLiMgui when both mutations and substitutions are being displayed in the chromosome view.  Outside of SLiMgui, this property still exists, but is not used by SLiM.  Colors may be specified by name, or with hexadecimal RGB values of the form 
\f3\fs18 "#RRGGBB"
\f4\fs20 .  If 
\f3\fs18 colorSubstitution
\f4\fs20  is the empty string, 
\f3\fs18 ""
\f4\fs20 , SLiMgui will defer to the color scheme of each 
\f3\fs18 MutationType
\f4\fs20 , just as it does when only substitutions are being displayed.  The default, 
\f3\fs18 "3333FF"
\f4\fs20 , causes all substitutions to be shown as dark blue when displayed in conjunction with mutations, to prevent the view from becoming too noisy.  Note that when substitutions are displayed without mutations also being displayed, this value is ignored by SLiMgui and the substitutions use the color scheme of each 
\f3\fs18 MutationType

\f3\fs18 "string"
\f4\fs20  format will be the most memory-efficient, and may also be the fastest (but may be harder to work with).\
For purposes related to interpreting the nucleotide sequence as a coding sequence, a format of 
\f3\fs18 "codon"
\f4\fs20  is also supported.  This format will return an 
\f3\fs18 integer
\f4\fs20  vector with values from 
\f3\fs18 0
\f4\fs20  to 
\f3\fs18 63
\f4\fs20 , based upon successive nucleotide triplets in the sequence (which, for this format, must have a length that is a multiple of three).  The codon value for a given nucleotide triplet XYZ is 16X\'a0+\'a04Y\'a0+\'a0Z, where X, Y, and Z have the usual values A=
\f3\fs18 0
\f4\fs20 , C=
\f3\fs18 1
\f4\fs20 , G=
\f3\fs18 2
\f4\fs20 , T=
\f3\fs18 3
\f4\fs20 .  For example, the triplet AAA has a codon value of 
\f3\fs18 0
\f4\fs20 , AAC is 
\f3\fs18 1
\f4\fs20 , AAG is 
\f3\fs18 2
\f4\fs20 , AAT is 
\f3\fs18 3
\f4\fs20 , ACA is 
\f3\fs18 4
\f4\fs20 , and on upward to TTT which is 
\f3\fs18 63
\f4\fs20 .  If the nucleotide sequence AACACATTT is requested in codon format, the codon vector 
\f3\fs18 1 4 63
\f4\fs20  will therefore be returned.  These codon values can be useful in themselves; they can also be passed to 
\f3\fs18 codonToAminoAcid()
\f4\fs20  to translate them into the corresponding amino acid sequence if desired.\

\f3\fs18 recombination()
\f4\fs20  callbacks.  The number of breakpoints to generate, 
\f3\fs18 n
\f4\fs20 , may be supplied; if it is 
\f3\fs18 NULL
\f4\fs20  (the default), the number of breakpoints will be drawn based upon the overall recombination rate and the chromosome length (following the standard procedure in SLiM).  Note that if the double-stranded breaks model has been chosen, the number of breakpoints generated will probably not be equal to the number requested, because most breakpoints will entail gene conversion tracts, which entail additional crossover breakpoints.\
It is generally recommended that the parent individual be supplied to this method, but 
\f3\fs18 parent
\f4\fs20  is 
\f3\fs18 NULL
\f4\fs20  by default.  The individual supplied in 
\f3\fs18 parent
\f4\fs20  is used for two purposes.  First, in sexual models that define separate recombination rate maps for males versus females, the sex of 
\f3\fs18 parent
\f4\fs20  will be used to determine which map is used; in this case, a non-
\f3\fs18 NULL
\f4\fs20  value 
\f1\i must
\f4\i0  be supplied for 
\f3\fs18 parent
\f4\fs20 , since the choice of recombination rate map must be determined.  Second, in models that define 
\f3\fs18 recombination()
\f4\fs20  callbacks, 
\f3\fs18 parent
\f4\fs20  is used to determine the various pseudo-parameters that are passed to 
\f3\fs18 recombination()
\f4\fs20  callbacks (
\f3\fs18 individual
\f4\fs20 , 
\f3\fs18 genome1
\f4\fs20 , 
\f3\fs18 genome2
\f4\fs20 , 
\f3\fs18 subpop
\f4\fs20 ), and the subpopulation to which 
\f3\fs18 parent
\f4\fs20  belongs is used to select which 
\f3\fs18 recombination()
\f4\fs20  callbacks are applicable; given the necessity of this information, 
\f3\fs18 recombination()
\f4\fs20  callbacks will not be called as a side effect of this method if 
\f3\fs18 parent
\f4\fs20  is 
\f3\fs18 NULL
\f4\fs20 .  Apart from these two uses, 
\f3\fs18 parent
\f4\fs20  is not used, and the caller does not guarantee that the generated breakpoints will actually be used to recombine the genomes of 
\f3\fs18 parent
\f4\fs20  in particular.\

\cf0 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 Beginning in SLiM 2.5 this method is vectorized, so all of these parameters may be singletons (in which case that single value is used for all mutations created by the call) or non-singleton vectors (in which case one element is used for each corresponding mutation created).  Non-singleton parameters must match in length, since their elements need to be matched up one-to-one.\
The new mutations created by this method are returned, even if their actual addition is prevented by the mutation stacking policy (see the

\f4\fs20  property of

\f4\fs20  parameter is specified in ascending order.  In other words, pre-sorting the parameters to this method into ascending order by position, using 
\f3\fs18 order()
\f4\fs20  and subsetting, will guarantee that the order of the returned vector of mutations corresponds to the order of elements in the parameters to this method; otherwise, no such guarantee exists.\
Beginning in SLiM 2.1, this is a class method, not an instance method.  This means that it does not get multiplexed out to all of the elements of the receiver (which would add a different new mutation to each element); instead, it is performed as a single operation, adding the same new mutation objects to all of the elements of the receiver.  Before SLiM 2.1, to add the same mutations to multiple genomes, it was necessary to call 
\f3\fs18 addNewDrawnMutation()
\f4\fs20  on one of the genomes, and then add the returned 
\f3\fs18 Mutation
\f4\fs20  object to all of the other genomes using

\f4\fs20 , simply call 
\f3\fs18 pN.genomes.readFromMS()
\f4\fs20 , assuming the subpopulation\'92s size matches that of the MS file.  A vector containing all of the mutations created by

\f4\fs20  is returned.\
Each mutation is created at the position specified in the file, using the mutation type given by 
\f3\fs18 mutationType
\f4\fs20 .  Positions are expected to be in [0,1], and are scaled to the length of the chromosome by multiplying by the last valid base position of the chromosome (i.e., one less than the chromosome length).  Selection coefficients are drawn from the mutation type.  The population of origin for each mutation is set to 
\f3\fs18 -1
\f4\fs20 , and the generation of origin is set to the current generation.  In a nucleotide-based model, if 
\f3\fs18 mutationType
\f4\fs20  is nucleotide-based, a random nucleotide different from the ancestral nucleotide at the position will be chosen with equal probability.\
The target genomes correspond, in order, to the call lines in the MS file.  In sex-based models that simulate the X or Y chromosome, null genomes in the target vector will be skipped, and will not be used to correspond to any call line; however, care should be taken in this case that the lines in the MS file correspond to the target genomes in the manner desired.\

\f4\fs20 , simply call

SLiM\'92s VCF parsing is quite primitive.  The header is parsed only inasmuch as SLiM looks to see whether SLiM-specific VCF fields are defined or not; the rest of the header information is ignored.  Call lines are assumed to follow the format:\

\f3\fs18 #CHROM POS ID REF ALT QUAL FILTER INFO FORMAT i0...iN\

\f3\fs18 CHROM

\f4\fs20 , and 
\f3\fs18 FORMAT
\f4\fs20  fields are ignored, and information in the genotype fields beyond the 
\f3\fs18 GT
\f4\fs20  genotype subfield are also ignored.  SLiM\'92s own VCF annotations are honored; in particular, mutations will be created using the given values of 
\f3\fs18 MID
\f4\fs20 , 
\f3\fs18 S
\f4\fs20 , 
\f3\fs18 PO
\f4\fs20 , 
\f3\fs18 GO
\f4\fs20 , and 
\f3\fs18 MT
\f4\fs20  if those subfields are present, and 
\f3\fs18 DOM
\f4\fs20 , if it is present, must match the dominance coefficient of the mutation type.  The parameter 
\f3\fs18 mutationType
\f4\fs20  (a 
\f3\fs18 MutationType
\f4\fs20  object or id) will be used for any mutations that have no supplied mutation type id in the 
\f3\fs18 MT
\f4\fs20  subfield; if 
\f3\fs18 mutationType
\f4\fs20  would be used but is 
\f3\fs18 NULL
\f4\fs20  an error will result.  Mutation IDs supplied in 
\f3\fs18 MID
\f4\fs20  will be used if no mutation IDs have been used in the simulation so far; if any have been used, it is difficult for SLiM to guarantee that there are no conflicts, so a warning will be emitted and the 
\f3\fs18 MID
\f4\fs20  values will be ignored.  If selection coefficients are not supplied with the 
\f3\fs18 S
\f4\fs20  subfield, they will be drawn from the mutation type used for the mutation.  If a population of origin is not supplied with the 
\f3\fs18 PO
\f4\fs20  subfield, 
\f3\fs18 -1
\f4\fs20  will be used.  If a generation of origin is not supplied with the 
\f3\fs18 GO
\f4\fs20  subfield, the current generation will be used.\

\f3\fs18 REF
\f4\fs20  and 
\f3\fs18 ALT
\f4\fs20  must always be comprised of simple nucleotides (
\f3\fs18 A
\f4\fs20 /
\f3\fs18 C
\f4\fs20 /
\f3\fs18 G
\f4\fs20 /
\f3\fs18 T
\f4\fs20 ) rather than values representing indels or other complex states.  Beyond this, the handling of the 
\f3\fs18 REF
\f4\fs20  and 
\f3\fs18 ALT
\f4\fs20  fields depends upon several factors.  First of all, these fields are ignored in non-nucleotide-based models, although they are still checked for conformance.  In nucleotide-based models, when a header definition for SLiM\'92s 
\f3\fs18 NONNUC
\f4\fs20  tag is present (as when nucleotide-based output is generated by SLiM): Second, if a 
\f3\fs18 NONNUC
\f4\fs20  field is present in the 
\f3\fs18 INFO
\f4\fs20  field the call line is taken to represent a non-nucleotide-based mutation, and 
\f3\fs18 REF
\f4\fs20  and 
\f3\fs18 ALT
\f4\fs20  are again ignored.  In this case the mutation type used must be non-nucleotide-based.  Third, if 
\f3\fs18 NONNUC
\f4\fs20  is 
\f1\i not
\f4\i0  present the call line is taken to represent a nucleotide-based mutation.  In this case, the mutation type used must be nucleotide-based.  Also, in this case, the specified reference nucleotide must match the existing ancestral nucleotide at the given position.  In nucleotide-based models, when a header definition for SLiM\'92s 
\f3\fs18 NONNUC
\f4\fs20  tag is not present (as when loading a non-SLiM-generated VCF file): The mutation type will govern the way nucleotides are handled.  If the mutation type used for a mutation is nucleotide-based, the nucleotide provided in the VCF file for that allele will be used.  If the mutation type is non-nucleotide-based, the nucleotide provided will be ignored.\
If multiple alleles using the same nucleotide at the same position are specified in the VCF file, a separate mutation will be created for each, mirroring SLiM\'92s behavior with independent mutational lineages when writing VCF.  The 
\f3\fs18 MULTIALLELIC
\f4\fs20  flag is ignored by 
\f3\fs18 readFromVCF()
\f4\fs20 ; call lines for mutations at the same base position in the same genome will result in stacked mutations whether or not 
\f3\fs18 MULTIALLELIC
\f4\fs20  is present.\
The target genomes correspond, in order, to the haploid or diploid calls provided for 
\f3\fs18 i0
\f4\fs20 \'85
\f3\fs18 iN
\f4\fs20  (the sample IDs) in the VCF file.  In sex-based models that simulate the X or Y chromosome, null genomes in the target vector will be skipped, and will not be used to correspond to any of 
\f3\fs18 i0
\f4\fs20 \'85
\f3\fs18 iN
\f4\fs20 ; however, care should be taken in this case that the genomes in the VCF file correspond to the target genomes in the manner desired.\

\f3\fs18 mutations
\f4\fs20  (which is the default), then all mutations will be removed from the target genomes; in this case, 
\f3\fs18 substitute
\f4\fs20  must be 
\f3\fs18 F
\f4\fs20  (a specific vector of mutations to be substituted is required).  Note that the 
\f3\fs18 Mutation
\f4\fs20  objects removed remain valid, and will still be in the simulation\'92s mutation registry (i.e. will be returned by 
\f3\fs18 SLiMSim
\f4\fs20 \'92s 
\f3\fs18 mutations
\f4\fs20  property), until the next generation.\
Changing this will normally affect the fitness values calculated at the end of the current generation; if you want current fitness values to be affected, you can call 
\f3\fs18 SLiMSim
\f4\fs20 \'92s method 
\f3\fs18 recalculateFitness()
\f4\fs20  \'96 but see the documentation of that method for caveats.\
The optional parameter 
\f3\fs18 substitute
\f4\fs20  was added in SLiM 2.2, with a default of 
\f3\fs18 F
\f4\fs20  for backward compatibility.  If 
\f3\fs18 substitute
\f4\fs20  is 
\f3\fs18 T
\f4\fs20 , 
\f3\fs18 Substitution
\f4\fs20  objects will be created for all of the removed mutations so that they are recorded in the simulation as having fixed, just as if they had reached fixation and been removed by SLiM\'92s own internal machinery.  This will occur regardless of whether the mutations have in fact fixed, regardless of the 
\f3\fs18 convertToSubstitution
\f4\fs20  property of the relevant mutation types, and regardless of whether all copies of the mutations have even been removed from the simulation (making it possible to create 
\f3\fs18 Substitution
\f4\fs20  objects for mutations that are still segregating).  It is up to the caller to perform whatever checks are necessary to preserve the integrity of the simulation\'92s records.  Typically 
\f3\fs18 substitute
\f4\fs20  will only be set to 
\f3\fs18 T
\f4\fs20  in the context of calls like 
\f3\fs18 sim.subpopulations.genomes.removeMutations(muts, T)

\f4\fs20  contributes

\f4\fs20 \cf2 Sets the spatial position of the individual (as accessed through the

\f4\fs20  property).  The length of 
\f3\fs18 position
\f4\fs20  (the number of coordinates in the spatial position of an individual) depends upon the spatial dimensionality declared with 
\f3\fs18 initializeSLiMOptions()
\f4\fs20 .  If the spatial dimensionality is zero (as it is by default), it is an error to call this method.  The elements of 
\f3\fs18 position
\f4\fs20  are set into the values of the 
\f3\fs18 x
\f4\fs20 , 
\f3\fs18 y
\f4\fs20 , and 
\f3\fs18 z
\f4\fs20  properties (if those properties are encompassed by the spatial dimensionality of the simulation).  In other words, if the declared dimensionality is 
\f3\fs18 "xy"
\f4\fs20 , calling 
\f3\fs18 individual.setSpatialPosition(c(1.0, 0.5))
\f4\fs20  property is equivalent to 
\f3\fs18 individual.x\'a0=\'a01.0; individual.y\'a0=\'a00.5
\f4\fs20 ; 
\f3\fs18 individual.z
\f4\fs20  is not set (even if a third value is supplied in 
\f3\fs18 position
\f4\fs20 ) since it is not encompassed by the simulation\'92s dimensionality in this example.\
Note that this is an Eidos class method, somewhat unusually, which allows it to work in a special way when called on a vector of individuals.  When the target vector of individuals is non-singleton, this method can do one of two things.  If 
\f3\fs18 position
\f4\fs20  contains just a single point (i.e., is equal in length to the spatial dimensionality of the model), the spatial position of all of the target individuals will be set to the given point.  Alternatively, if 
\f3\fs18 position
\f4\fs20  contains one point per target individual (i.e., is equal in length to the number of individuals multiplied by the spatial dimensionality of the model), the spatial position of each target individual will be set to the corresponding point from 
\f3\fs18 position
\f4\fs20  (where the point data is concatenated, not interleaved, just as it would be returned by accessing the 
\f3\fs18 spatialPosition
\f4\fs20  property on the vector of target individuals).  Calling this method with a

Returns up to

\f4\fs20  individuals drawn from the subpopulation of 
\f3\fs18 individual
\f4\fs20 .  The probability of drawing particular individuals is proportional to the strength of interaction they exert upon 
\f3\fs18 individual
\f4\fs20 .  This method may be used with either spatial or non-spatial interactions, but will be more efficient with spatial interactions that set a short maximum interaction distance.  Draws are done with replacement, so the same individual may be drawn more than once; sometimes using 
\f3\fs18 unique()
\f4\fs20  on the result of this call is therefore desirable.  If more than one draw will be needed, it is much more efficient to use a single call to 
\f3\fs18 drawByStrength()
\f4\fs20 , rather than drawing individuals one at a time.  Note that if no individuals exert a non-zero interaction upon 
\f3\fs18 individual
\f4\fs20 , the vector returned will be zero-length; it is important to consider this possibility.\
If the needed interaction strengths have already been calculated, those cached values are simply used.  Otherwise, calling this method triggers evaluation of the needed interactions, including calls to any applicable

At a minimum, is it guaranteed that this method will discard all previously cached data for the subpopulation(s), and will cache the current spatial positions of all individuals (so that individuals may then move without disturbing the state of the interaction at the moment of evaluation).  Notably, 
\f3\fs18 interaction()
\f4\fs20  callbacks may not be called in response to this method; instead, their evaluation may be deferred until required to satisfy queries (at which point the generation counter may have advanced by one, so be careful with the generation ranges used in defining such callbacks).\

If 
\f3\fs18 T
\f4\fs20  is passed for 
\f3\fs18 immediate
\f4\fs20 , the interaction will immediately and synchronously evaluate all interactions between all individuals in the subpopulation(s), calling any applicable 
\f3\fs18 interaction()
\f4\fs20  callbacks as necessary \'96 if the interaction is spatial (see below).  However, depending upon what queries are later executed, this may represent considerable wasted computation.  Immediate evaluation usually generates only a slight performance improvement even if the interactions between all pairs of individuals are eventually accessed; the main reason to choose immediate evaluation, then, is that deferred calculation of interactions would lead to incorrect results due to changes in model state.  For non-spatial interactions, distances and interaction strengths are never cached since such caching would require O(N
\fs13\fsmilli6667 \super 2
\fs20 \nosupersub ) memory and time, which is deemed unacceptable in general; for non-spatial interactions, the

You must explicitly call 
\f3\fs18 evaluate()
\f4\fs20  at an appropriate time in the life cycle before the interaction is used, but after any relevant changes have been made to the population.  SLiM will invalidate any existing interactions after any portion of the generation cycle in which new individuals have been born or existing individuals have died.  In a WF model, these events occur just before 
\f3\fs18 late()
\f4\fs20  events execute (see the WF generation cycle diagram), so 
\f3\fs18 late()
\f4\fs20  events are often the appropriate place to put 
\f3\fs18 evaluate()
\f4\fs20  calls, but 
\f3\fs18 early()
\f4\fs20  events can work too if the interaction is not needed until that point in the generation cycle anyway. In nonWF models, on the other hand, new offspring are produced just before 
\f3\fs18 early()
\f4\fs20  events and then individuals die just before 
\f3\fs18 late()
\f4\fs20  events (see the nonWF generation cycle diagram), so interactions will be invalidated twice during each generation cycle.  This means that in a nonWF model, an interaction that influences reproduction should usually be evaluated in a 
\f3\fs18 late()
\f4\fs20  event, while an interaction that influences fitness or mortality should usually be evaluated in an 
\f3\fs18 early()
\f4\fs20  event (and an interaction that affects both may need to be evaluated at both times).\

\f4\fs20 \cf2 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
This property governs whether mutations of this mutation type will be converted to 
\f3\fs18 Substitution
\f4\fs20  objects when they reach fixation.\
In WF models this property is 
\f3\fs18 T
\f4\fs20  by default, since conversion to 
\f3\fs18 Substitution
\f4\fs20  objects provides large speed benefits; it should be set to 
\f3\fs18 F
\f4\fs20  only if necessary, and only on the mutation types for which it is necessary.  This might be needed, for example, if you are using a 
\f3\fs18 fitness()
\f4\fs20  callback to implement an epistatic relationship between mutations; a mutation epistatically influencing the fitness of other mutations through a 
\f3\fs18 fitness()
\f4\fs20  callback would need to continue having that influence even after reaching fixation, but if the simulation were to replace the fixed mutation with a 
\f3\fs18 Substitution
\f4\fs20  object the mutation would no longer be considered in fitness calculations (unless the callback explicitly consulted the list of 
\f3\fs18 Substitution
\f4\fs20  objects kept by the simulation).  Other script-defined behaviors in 
\f3\fs18 fitness()
\f4\fs20 , 
\f3\fs18 interaction()
\f4\fs20 , 
\f3\fs18 mateChoice()
\f4\fs20 , 
\f3\fs18 modifyChild()
\f4\fs20 , and 
\f3\fs18 recombination()
\f4\fs20  callbacks might also necessitate the disabling of substitution for a given mutation type; this is an important consideration to keep in mind.\
In contrast, for nonWF models this property is 
\f3\fs18 F
\f4\fs20  by default, because even mutations with no epistatis or other indirect fitness effects will continue to influence the survival probabilities of individuals.  For nonWF models, only neutral mutation types with no epistasis or other side effects can safely be converted to substitutions upon fixation.  When such a pure-neutral mutation type is defined in a nonWF model, this property should be set to 
\f3\fs18 T
\f4\fs20  to tell SLiM that substitution is allowed; this may have very large positive effects on performance, so it is important to remember when modeling background neutral mutations.\
SLiM consults this flag at the end of each generation when deciding whether to substitute each fixed mutation.  If this flag is 
\f3\fs18 T
\f4\fs20 , all eligible fixed mutations will be converted at the end of the current generation, even if they were previously left unconverted because of the previous value of the flag.  Setting this flag to 
\f3\fs18 F
\f4\fs20  will prevent future substitutions, but will not cause any existing 
\f3\fs18 Substitution
\f4\fs20  objects to be converted back into 
\f3\fs18 Mutation
\f4\fs20  objects.\

\f4\b0 cript-based fitness effect.  This DFE type is specified by a script parameter of type 
\f3\fs18 string
\f4\fs22 , specifying an Eidos script to be executed to produce each new selection coefficient.  For example, the script 
\f3\fs18 "return rbinom(1);"
\f4\fs22  could be used to generate selection coefficients drawn from a binomial distribution, using the Eidos function 
\f3\fs18 rbinom()
\f4\fs22 , even though that mutational distribution is not supported by SLiM directly.  The script must return a singleton float or integer.\
Note that these distributions can in principle produce selection coefficients smaller than 
\f3\fs18 -1.0. 
\f4\fs22 In that case
\f5 ,
\f4  the mutations will be evaluated as \'93lethal\'94 by SLiM, and the relative fitness of the individual will be set to

\pard\pardeftab720\li547\ri720\sb60\sa60\partightenfactor0

\f4\fs20 \cf0 The dominance coefficient used for mutations of this type when heterozygous.  Changing this will normally affect the fitness values calculated at the end of the current generation; if you want current fitness values to be affected, you can call 
\f3\fs18 SLiMSim
\f4\fs20 \'92s method 
\f3\fs18 recalculateFitness()
\f4\fs20  \'96 but see the documentation of that method for caveats.\
Note that the dominance coefficient is not bounded.  A dominance coefficient greater than 
\f3\fs18 1.0
\f4\fs20  may be used to achieve an overdominance effect.  By making the selection coefficient very small and the dominance coefficient very large, an overdominance scenario in which both homozygotes have the same fitness may be approximated, to a nearly arbitrary degree of precision.\
Note that this property has a quirk: it is stored internally in SLiM using a single-precision float, not the double-precision float type normally used by Eidos.  This means that if you set a mutation type 
\f3\fs18 muttype
\f4\fs20 \'92s dominance coefficient to some number 
\f3\fs18 x
\f4\fs20 , 
\f3\fs18 muttype.dominanceCoeff==x
\f4\fs20  may be

\f3\fs18 mutationStackGroup
\f4\fs20  is called a \'93stacking group\'94, and all mutation types in a given stacking group must have the same 
\f3\fs18 mutationStackPolicy
\f4\fs20  value, which defines the stacking behavior of all mutations of the mutation types in the stacking group.  In other words, one stacking group might allow its mutations to stack, while another stacking group might not, but the policy within each stacking group must be unambiguous.\

This property is

\f3\fs18 "f"
\f4\fs20 , the 
\f1\i first
\f4\i0  mutation of stacking group at a given site is retained; further mutations of this stacking group at the same site are discarded with no effect.  This can be useful for modeling one-way changes; once a gene is disabled by a premature stop codon, for example, you might wish to assume, for simplicity, that further mutations cannot alter that fact.  If the policy is set to 
\f3\fs18 "l"
\f4\fs20 , the 
\f1\i last
\f4\i0  mutation of this stacking group at a given site is retained; earlier mutation of this stacking group at the same site are discarded.  This can be useful for modeling an \'93infinite-alleles\'94 scenario in which every new mutation at a site generates a completely new allele, rather than retaining the previous mutations at the site.\

\cf0 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 The mutation stacking policy applies only within the given mutation type\'92s stacking group; mutations of different stacking groups are always allowed to stack in SLiM.

\f3\fs18 addNewMutation()
\f4\fs20 , or 
\f3\fs18 addNewDrawnMutation()
\f4\fs20 , or are added by SLiM\'92s own mutation-generation machinery.  However, no attempt is made to enforce the policy for mutations already existing at the time the policy is set; typically, therefore, the policy is set in an 
\f3\fs18 initialize()
\f4\fs20  callback so that it applies throughout the simulation.  The policy is also not enforced upon the mutations loaded from a file with 
\f3\fs18 readFromPopulationFile()
\f4\fs20 ; such mutations were governed by whatever stacking policy was in effect when the population file was generated.

\f4\fs20 \cf2 Pauses a model that is playing in SLiMgui.  This is essentially equivalent to clicking the \'93Play\'94 button to stop the execution of the model.  Execution can be resumed by the user, by clicking the \'93Play\'94 button again; unlike calling 
\f3\fs18 stop()
\f4\fs20  or 
\f3\fs18 simulationFinished()
\f4\fs20 , the simulation is not terminated.  This method can be useful for debugging or exploratory purposes, to pause the model at a point of interest.  Execution is paused at the end of the currently executing generation, not mid-generation.\
If the model is being profiled, or is executing forward to a generation number entered in the generation field, 
\f3\fs18 pauseExecution()
\f4\fs20  will do nothing; by design, 
\f3\fs18 pauseExecution()
\f4\fs20  only pauses execution when SLiMgui is doing a simple \'93Play\'94 of the model.\

Binary files are not guaranteed to be portable between platforms; in other words, a binary file written on one machine may not be readable on a different machine (but in practice it usually will be, unless the platforms being used are fairly unusual).

Beginning with SLiM 3.3, the

\f4\fs20 , the output will not contain ancestral nucleotide information, and so the ancestral sequence will not be restored correctly if the saved file is loaded with

New symbols will be defined to refer to the new 
\f3\fs18 Subpopulation
\f4\fs20  objects loaded from the file.\
If the file being read was written by a version of SLiM prior to 2.3, then for backward compatibility fitness values will be calculated immediately for any new subpopulations created by this call, which will trigger the calling of any activated and applicable 
\f3\fs18 fitness()
\f4\fs20  callbacks.  When reading files written by SLiM 2.3 or later, fitness values are not calculated as a side effect of this call (because the simulation will often need to evaluate interactions or modify other state prior to doing so).\

\cf0 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 As of SLiM 2.1, this method changes the generation counter to the generation read from the file.  If you do not want the generation counter to be changed, you can change it back after reading, by setting 
\f3\fs18 sim.generation
\f4\fs20  to whatever value you wish.  Note that restoring a saved past state and running forward again will not yield the same simulation results, because the random number generator\'92s state will not be the same; to ensure reproducibility from a given time point, 
\f3\fs18 setSeed()
\f4\fs20  can be used to establish a new seed value.  Any changes made to the simulation\'92s structure (mutation types, genomic element types, etc.) will not be wiped and re-established by 
\f3\fs18 readFromPopulationFile()
\f4\fs20 ; this method loads only the population\'92s state, not the simulation configuration, so care should be taken to ensure that the simulation structure meshes coherently with the loaded data.\
As of SLiM 2.3, this method will read and restore the spatial positions of individuals if that information is present in the output file and the simulation has enabled continuous space (see 
\f3\fs18 outputFull()
\f4\fs20  for details).  If spatial positions are present in the output file but the simulation has not enabled continuous space (or the number of spatial dimensions does not match), an error will result.  If the simulation has enabled continuous space but spatial positions are not present in the output file, the spatial positions of the individuals read will be undefined, but an error is not raised.\

As of SLiM 3.0, this method will read and restore the ages of individuals if that information is present in the output file and the simulation is based upon the nonWF model.  If ages are present but the simulation uses a WF model, an error will result; the WF model does not use age information.  If ages are not present but the simulation uses a nonWF model, an error will also result; the nonWF model requires age information.\
As of SLiM 3.3, this method will restore the nucleotides of nucleotide-based mutations, and will restore the ancestral nucleotide sequence, if that information is present in the output file.  Loading an output file that contains nucleotide information in a non-nucleotide-based model, and 
\f1\i vice versa
\f4\i0 , will produce an error.\

\f3\fs18 pyslim
\f4\fs20  package.  When loading a tree sequence, a crosscheck of the loaded data will be performed to ensure that the tree sequence was well-formed and was loaded correctly.  When running a Release build of SLiM, however, this crosscheck will only occur the first time that 
\f3\fs18 readFromPopulationFile()
\f4\fs20  is called to load a tree sequence; subsequent calls will not perform this crosscheck, for greater speed when running models that load saved population state many times (such as models that are conditional on fixation).  If you suspect that a tree sequence file might be corrupted or read incorrectly, running a Debug build of SLiM enables crosschecks after every load.\

\f4\fs20  (the default), the simulation\'92s current generation value,

\f4\fs20  in order to utilize the 
\f3\fs18 fitness()
\f4\fs20  callbacks for the previous generation, as if the changes that you have made to fitness-influencing parameters were already in effect at the end of the previous generation when the new generation was first created and evaluated (usually it is simpler to just make such changes in a

\f4\fs20  event instead, however, in which case calling

\f4\fs20  inside

\f4\fs20 \cf0 Reschedule the target script block given by 
\f3\fs18 block
\f4\fs20  to execute in a specified set of generations.\
The first way to specify the generation set is with 
\f3\fs18 start
\f4\fs20  and 
\f3\fs18 end
\f4\fs20  parameter values; 
\f3\fs18 block
\f4\fs20  will then execute from 
\f3\fs18 start
\f4\fs20  to 
\f3\fs18 end
\f4\fs20 , inclusive.  In this case, 
\f3\fs18 block
\f4\fs20  is returned.\
The second way to specify the generation set is using the 
\f3\fs18 generations
\f4\fs20  parameter; this is more flexible but more complicated.  Since script blocks execute across a contiguous span of generations defined by their 
\f3\fs18 start
\f4\fs20  and 
\f3\fs18 end
\f4\fs20  properties, this may result in the duplication of 
\f3\fs18 block
\f4\fs20 ; one script block will be used for each contiguous span of generations in 
\f3\fs18 generations
\f5\fs20 .
\f4   The 
\f3\fs18 block
\f4\fs20  object itself will be rescheduled to cover the first such span, whereas duplicates of 
\f3\fs18 block
\f4\fs20  will be created to cover subsequent contiguous spans.  A vector containing all of the script blocks scheduled by this method, including 
\f3\fs18 block
\f4\fs20 , will be returned; this vector is guaranteed to be sorted by the (ascending) scheduled execution order of the blocks.  Any duplicates of 
\f3\fs18 block
\f4\fs20  created will be given values for the 
\f3\fs18 active
\f4\fs20 , 
\f3\fs18 source
\f4\fs20 , 
\f3\fs18 tag
\f4\fs20 , and 
\f3\fs18 type
\f4\fs20  properties equal to the current values for 
\f3\fs18 block
\f4\fs20 , but will be given an 
\f3\fs18 id
\f4\fs20  of 
\f3\fs18 -1
\f4\fs20  since script block identifiers must be unique; if it is necessary to find the duplicated blocks again later, their 
\f3\fs18 tag
\f4\fs20  property should be used.  The vector supplied for 
\f3\fs18 generations
\f4\fs20  does not need to be in sorted order, but it must not contain any duplicates.\
Because this method can create a large number of duplicate script blocks, it can sometimes be better to handle script block scheduling in other ways.  If an 
\f3\fs18 early()
\f4\fs20  event needs to execute every tenth generation over the whole duration of a long model run, for example, it would not be advisable to use a call like 
\f3\fs18 sim.rescheduleScriptBlock(s1, generations=seq(10, 100000, 10))
\f4\fs20  for that purpose, since that would result in thousands of duplicate script blocks.  Instead, it would be preferable to add a test such as 
\f3\fs18 if (sim.generation % 10 != 0) return;
\f4\fs20  at the beginning of the event.  It is legal to reschedule a script block while the block is executing; a call like 
\f3\fs18 sim.rescheduleScriptBlock(self, sim.generation + 10, sim.generation + 10);
\f4\fs20  made inside a given block would therefore also cause the block to execute every tenth generation, although this sort of self-rescheduling code is probably harder to read, maintain, and debug.\
Whichever way of specifying the generation set is used, 
\f3\fs18 block
\f4\fs20  may continue to be executed during the current life cycle stage even after it has been rescheduled, unless it is made inactive using its 
\f3\fs18 active
\f4\fs20  property, and similarly, the block may not execute during the current life cycle stage if it was not already scheduled to do so.  Rescheduling script blocks during the generation and life cycle stage in which they are executing, or in which they are intended to execute, should be avoided.\cf2   Also, as mentioned in section 21.7, script blocks which are open-ended (i.e., with no specified end generation), are not used in determining whether the end of the simulation has been reached (because then the simulation would run forever); if you reschedule a block to be open-ended, and to start after the end of the last closed-ended block, the rescheduled block will therefore not run at all (just as such a block would not run at all in other circumstances, too).\cf0 \
Note that new script blocks can also be created and scheduled using the 
\f3\fs18 register...()
\f4\fs20  methods of 
\f3\fs18 SLiMSim
\f4\fs20 ; by using the same source as a template script block, the template can be duplicated and scheduled for different generations.  In fact, 
\f3\fs18 rescheduleScriptBlock()
\f4\fs20  does essentially that internally.

\f4\fs20 \cf2 Returns the coalescence state for the recorded tree sequence at the last simplification.  The returned value is a logical singleton flag, 
\f3\fs18 T
\f4\fs20  to indicate that full coalescence was observed at the last tree-sequence simplification (meaning that there is a single ancestral individual that roots all ancestry trees at all sites along the chromosome \'96 although not necessarily the 
\f1\i same
\f4\i0  ancestor at all sites), or 
\f3\fs18 F
\f4\fs20  if full coalescence was not observed.  For simple models, reaching coalescence may indicate that the model has reached an equilibrium state, but this may not be true in models that modify the dynamics of the model during execution by changing migration rates, introducing new mutations programmatically, dictating non-random mating, etc., so be careful not to attach more meaning to coalescence than it is due; some models may require burn-in beyond coalescence to reach equilibrium, or may not have an equilibrium state at all.  Also note that some actions by a model, such as adding a new subpopulation, may cause the coalescence state to revert from 
\f3\fs18 T
\f4\fs20  back to 
\f3\fs18 F
\f4\fs20  (at the next simplification), so a return value of 
\f3\fs18 T
\f4\fs20  may not necessarily mean that the model is coalesced at the present moment \'96 only that it 
\f1\i was
\f4\i0  coalesced at the last simplification.\
This method may only be called if tree sequence recording has been turned on with 
\f3\fs18 initializeTreeSeq()
\f4\fs20 ; in addition, 
\f3\fs18 checkCoalescence=T
\f4\fs20  must have been supplied to 
\f3\fs18 initializeTreeSeq()
\f4\fs20 , so that the necessary work is done during each tree-sequence simplification.  Since this method does not perform coalescence checking itself, but instead simply returns the coalescence state observed at the last simplification, it may be desirable to call 
\f3\fs18 treeSeqSimplify()
\f4\fs20  immediately before 
\f3\fs18 treeSeqCoalesced()
\f4\fs20  to obtain up-to-date information.  However, the speed penalty of doing this in every generation would be large, and most models do not need this level of precision; usually it is sufficient to know that the model has coalesced, without knowing whether that happened in the current generation or in a recent preceding generation.\

\f3\fs18 treeSeqRememberIndividuals()
\f4\fs20  is for 
\f1\i permanently
\f4\i0  adding particular individuals to the retained sample.  Typically this would be used, for example, to retain particular individuals that you wanted to be able to trace ancestry back to in later analysis.  However, this is not the typical usage pattern for tree sequence recording; most models will not need to call this method.\
The metadata (age, location, etc) that are stored in the resulting tree sequence are those values present at either (a) the final generation, if the individual is alive at the end of the simulation, or (b) the last time that the individual was remembered, if not.  Calling 
\f3\fs18 treeSeqRememberIndividuals()
\f4\fs20  on an individual that is already remembered will cause the archived information about the remembered individual to be updated to reflect the individual\'92s current state.  A case where this is particularly important is for the spatial location of individuals in continuous-space models.  SLiM automatically remembers the individuals that comprise the first generation of any new subpopulation created with 
\f3\fs18 addSubpop()
\f4\fs20 , for easy recapitation and other analysis.  However, since these first-generation individuals are remembered at the moment they are created, their spatial locations have not yet been set up, and will contain garbage \'96 and those garbage values will be archived in their remembered state.  If you need correct spatial locations of first-generation individuals for your post-simulation analysis, you should call 
\f3\fs18 treeSeqRememberIndividuals()
\f4\fs20  explicitly on the first generation, after setting spatial locations, to update the archived information with the correct spatial positions.\

Attempting to use a newly generated offspring individual as a mate, or to reference it as a member of the target subpopulation in any other way, will result in an error.  In most models the returned individual is not used, but it is provided for maximal generality and flexibility.\
The new offspring individual is generated from 
\f3\fs18 parent1
\f4\fs20  and 
\f3\fs18 parent2
\f4\fs20  by crossing them.  In sexual models 
\f3\fs18 parent1
\f4\fs20  must be female and

\f4\fs20  are unrestricted.  If 
\f3\fs18 parent1
\f4\fs20  and 
\f3\fs18 parent2
\f4\fs20  are the same individual in a hermaphroditic model, that parent self-fertilizes, or \'93selfs\'94, to generate the offspring sexually (note this is not the same as clonal reproduction).  Such selfing is considered \'93incidental\'94 by 
\f3\fs18 addCrossed()

\f4\fs20  and 
\f3\fs18 parent2
\f4\fs20  is an error (you must check for and prevent incidental selfing if you set that flag in a nonWF model).  If non-incidental selfing is desired, 
\f3\fs18 addSelfed()
\f4\fs20  should be used instead.\
The 
\f3\fs18 sex
\f4\fs20  parameter specifies the sex of the offspring.  A value of 
\f3\fs18 NULL
\f4\fs20  means \'93make the default choice\'94; in non-sexual models it is the only legal value for 
\f3\fs18 sex
\f4\fs20 , and does nothing, whereas in sexual models it causes male or female to be chosen with equal probability.  A value of 
\f3\fs18 "M"
\f4\fs20  or 
\f3\fs18 "F"
\f4\fs20  for 
\f3\fs18 sex
\f4\fs20  specifies that the offspring should be male or female, respectively.  Finally, a

\f4\fs20  value from 
\f3\fs18 0.0
\f4\fs20  to 
\f3\fs18 1.0
\f4\fs20  for 
\f3\fs18 sex
\f4\fs20  provides the probability that the offspring will be male; a value of 
\f3\fs18 0.0
\f4\fs20  will produce a female, a value of 
\f3\fs18 1.0
\f4\fs20  will produce a male, and for intermediate values SLiM will draw the sex of the offspring randomly according to the specified probability.  Unless you wish the bias the sex ratio of offspring, the default value of 
\f3\fs18 NULL
\f4\fs20  should generally be used.\
Note that any defined, active, and applicable 
\f3\fs18 recombination()
\f4\fs20 , 
\f3\fs18 mutation()
\f4\fs20 , and 
\f3\fs18 modifyChild()
\f4\fs20  callbacks will be called as a side effect of calling this method, before this method even returns.  For 
\f3\fs18 recombination()
\f4\fs20  and 
\f3\fs18 mutation()
\f4\fs20  callbacks, the subpopulation of the parent that is generating a given gamete is used; for 
\f3\fs18 modifyChild()
\f4\fs20  callbacks the situation is more complex.  In most biparental mating events, 
\f3\fs18 parent1
\f4\fs20  and 
\f3\fs18 parent2
\f4\fs20  will belong to the same subpopulation, and 
\f3\fs18 modifyChild()
\f4\fs20  callbacks for that subpopulation will be used, just as in WF models.  In certain models (such as models of pollen flow and broadcast spawning), however, biparental mating may occur between parents that are not from the same subpopulation; that is legal in nonWF models, and in that case, 
\f3\fs18 modifyChild()
\f4\fs20  callbacks for the subpopulation of 
\f3\fs18 parent1
\f4\fs20  are used (since that is the maternal parent).\
If the 
\f3\fs18 modifyChild()
\f4\fs20  callback process results in rejection of the proposed child, a new offspring individual will not be generated, and this method will return 
\f3\fs18 NULL
\f4\fs20 .  To force the generation of an offspring individual from a given pair of parents, you could loop until 
\f3\fs18 addCrossed()
\f4\fs20  succeeds, but note that if your 
\f3\fs18 modifyChild()
\f4\fs20  callback rejects all proposed children from those particular parents, your model will then hang, so care must be taken with this approach.  Usually, nonWF models do not force generation of offspring in this manner; rejection of a proposed offspring by a 
\f3\fs18 modifyChild()
\f4\fs20  callback typically represents a phenomenon such as post-mating reproductive isolation or lethal genetic incompatibilities that would reduce the expected litter size, so the default behavior is typically desirable.\
Note that this method is only for use in nonWF models, in which offspring generation is managed manually by the model script; in such models, 
\f3\fs18 addCrossed()
\f4\fs20  must be called only from 
\f3\fs18 reproduce()
\f4\fs20  callbacks, and may not be called at any other time.  In WF models, offspring generation is managed automatically by the SLiM core.\

\f4\fs20 \cf2 Generates a new offspring individual from the given parental genomes with the specified crossover breakpoints, queues it for addition to the target subpopulation, and returns it.  The new offspring will not be visible as a member of the target subpopulation until the end of the offspring generation life cycle stage.  The target subpopulation will be used to locate applicable 
\f3\fs18 mutation()
\f4\fs20  and 
\f3\fs18 modifyChild()
\f4\fs20  callbacks governing the generation of the offspring individual (unlike the other

\f4\fs20  methods, because there are potentially up to four parental individuals to reference); 
\f3\fs18 recombination()
\f4\fs20  callbacks will not be called by this method.  This method is an advanced feature; most models will use 
\f3\fs18 addCrossed()
\f4\fs20 , 
\f3\fs18 addSelfed()
\f4\fs20 , or 
\f3\fs18 addCloned()
\f4\fs20  instead.\
This method supports several possible configurations for 
\f3\fs18 strand1
\f4\fs20 , 
\f3\fs18 strand2
\f4\fs20 , and 
\f3\fs18 breaks1
\f4\fs20  (and the same applies for 
\f3\fs18 strand3
\f4\fs20 , 
\f3\fs18 strand4
\f4\fs20 , and 
\f3\fs18 breaks2
\f4\fs20 ).  If 
\f3\fs18 strand1
\f4\fs20  and 
\f3\fs18 strand2
\f4\fs20  are both 
\f3\fs18 NULL
\f4\fs20 , the corresponding genome in the generated offspring will be empty, as from 
\f3\fs18 addEmpty()
\f4\fs20 , with no parental genomes and no added mutations; in this case, 
\f3\fs18 breaks1
\f4\fs20  must be 
\f3\fs18 NULL
\f4\fs20  or zero-length.  If 
\f3\fs18 strand1
\f4\fs20  is non-
\f3\fs18 NULL
\f4\fs20  but 
\f3\fs18 strand2
\f4\fs20  is 
\f3\fs18 NULL
\f4\fs20 , the corresponding genome in the generated offspring will be a clonal copy of 
\f3\fs18 strand1
\f4\fs20  with mutations added, as from 
\f3\fs18 addCloned()
\f4\fs20 ; in this case, 
\f3\fs18 breaks1
\f4\fs20  must similarly be 
\f3\fs18 NULL
\f4\fs20  or zero-length.  If 
\f3\fs18 strand1
\f4\fs20  and 
\f3\fs18 strand2
\f4\fs20  are both non-
\f3\fs18 NULL
\f4\fs20 , the corresponding genome in the generated offspring will result from recombination between 
\f3\fs18 strand1
\f4\fs20  and 
\f3\fs18 strand2
\f4\fs20  with mutations added, as from 
\f3\fs18 addCrossed()
\f4\fs20 , with 
\f3\fs18 strand1
\f4\fs20  being the initial copy strand; copying will switch between strands at each breakpoint in 
\f3\fs18 breaks1
\f4\fs20 , which must be non-
\f3\fs18 NULL
\f4\fs20  but need not be sorted or uniqued (SLiM will sort and unique the supplied breakpoints internally).  (It is not currently legal for 
\f3\fs18 strand1
\f4\fs20  to be 
\f3\fs18 NULL
\f4\fs20  and 
\f3\fs18 strand2
\f4\fs20  non-
\f3\fs18 NULL
\f4\fs20 ; that variant may be assigned some meaning in future.)  Again, this discussion applies equally to 
\f3\fs18 strand3
\f4\fs20 , 
\f3\fs18 strand4
\f4\fs20 , and 
\f3\fs18 breaks2
\f4\fs20 , 
\f1\i mutatis mutandis
\f4\i0 .  Note that when new mutations are generated by 
\f3\fs18 addRecombinant()
\f4\fs20 , their 
\f3\fs18 subpopID
\f4\fs20  property will be the 
\f3\fs18 id
\f4\fs20  of the offspring\'92s subpopulation, since the parental subpopulation is ambiguous; this behavior differs from the other 
\f3\fs18 add...()
\f4\fs20  methods.\
The 
\f3\fs18 sex
\f4\fs20  parameter is interpreted exactly as in 
\f3\fs18 addCrossed()
\f4\fs20 ; see that method for discussion.  If the offspring sex is specified in any way (i.e., if 
\f3\fs18 sex
\f4\fs20  is non-
\f3\fs18 NULL
\f4\fs20 ), the strands provided must be compatible with the sex chosen.  If the offspring sex is not specified (i.e., if 
\f3\fs18 sex
\f4\fs20  is 
\f3\fs18 NULL
\f4\fs20 ), the sex will be inferred from the strands provided where possible (when modeling an X or Y chromosome), or will be chosen randomly otherwise (when modeling autosomes); it will 
\f1\i not
\f4\i0  be inferred from the sex of the individuals possessing the parental strands, even when the reproductive mode is essentially clonal from a single parent, since such inference would be ambiguous in the general case.  Similarly, the offspring is considered to have no parents for the purposes of pedigree tracking, since there may be more than two \'93parents\'94 in the general case.  When modeling the X or Y, 
\f3\fs18 strand1
\f4\fs20  and 
\f3\fs18 strand2
\f4\fs20  must be X genomes (or 
\f3\fs18 NULL
\f4\fs20 ), and 
\f3\fs18 strand3
\f4\fs20  and 
\f3\fs18 strand4
\f4\fs20  must both be X genomes or both be Y genomes (or 
\f3\fs18 NULL
\f4\fs20 ).\
These semantics allow several uses for 
\f3\fs18 addRecombinant()
\f4\fs20 .  When all strands are non-
\f3\fs18 NULL
\f4\fs20 , it is similar to 
\f3\fs18 addCrossed()
\f4\fs20  except that the recombination breakpoints are specified explicitly, allowing very precise offspring generation without having to override SLiM\'92s breakpoint generation with a 
\f3\fs18 recombination()
\f4\fs20  callback.  When only 
\f3\fs18 strand1
\f4\fs20  and 
\f3\fs18 strand3
\f4\fs20  are supplied, it is very similar to 
\f3\fs18 addCloned()
\f4\fs20 , creating a clonal offspring, except that the two parental genomes need not belong to the same individual (whatever that might mean biologically).  Supplying only 
\f3\fs18 strand1
\f4\fs20  is useful for modeling clonally reproducing haploids; the second genome of every offspring will be kept empty and will not receive new mutations.  For a model of clonally reproducing haploids that undergo horizontal gene transfer (HGT), supplying only 
\f3\fs18 strand1
\f4\fs20  and 
\f3\fs18 strand2
\f4\fs20  will allow HGT from 
\f3\fs18 strand2
\f4\fs20  to replace segments of an otherwise clonal copy of 
\f3\fs18 strand1
\f4\fs20 , while the second genome of the generated offspring will again be kept empty; this could be useful for modeling bacterial conjugation, for example.  Other variations are also possible.\
Note that gene conversion tracts are not explicitly supported by this method; the 
\f3\fs18 breaks
\f4\fs20  vectors provide crossover breakpoints, which may be used to implement crossovers or simple gene conversion tracts.  There is no way to specify complex gene conversion tracts with heteroduplex mismatch repair.\
Note that this method is only for use in nonWF models.  See 
\f3\fs18 addCrossed()
\f4\fs20  for further general notes on the addition of new offspring individuals.\

\f4\fs20 \cf2 Generates a new offspring individual from the given parent by selfing, queues it for addition to the target subpopulation, and returns it.  The new offspring will not be visible as a member of the target subpopulation until the end of the offspring generation life cycle stage.  The subpopulation of 
\f3\fs18 parent
\f4\fs20  will be used to locate applicable

\f4\fs20 , 
\f3\fs18 recombination()
\f4\fs20 , and 
\f3\fs18 modifyChild()
\f4\fs20  callbacks governing the generation of the offspring individual.\
Since selfing requires that 
\f3\fs18 parent
\f4\fs20  act as a source of both a male and a female gamete, this method may be called only in hermaphroditic models; calling it in sexual models will result in an error.  This method represents a non-incidental selfing event, so the 
\f3\fs18 preventIncidentalSelfing
\f4\fs20  flag of 
\f3\fs18 initializeSLiMOptions()
\f4\fs20  has no effect on this method (in contrast to the behavior of 
\f3\fs18 addCrossed()
\f4\fs20 , where selfing is assumed to be incidental).\
Note that this method is only for use in nonWF models.  See

\f4\fs20  from inside a

\f4\fs20 \cf2 This method customizes the display of the subpopulation in SLiMgui\'92s Population Visualization graph.  When this method is called by a model running outside SLiMgui, it will do nothing except type-checking and bounds-checking its arguments.  When called by a model running in SLiMgui, the position, size, and color of the subpopulation\'92s displayed circle can be controlled as specified below.\
The 
\f3\fs18 center
\f4\fs20  parameter sets the coordinates of the center of the subpopulation\'92s displayed circle; it must be a 
\f3\fs18 float
\f4\fs20  vector of length two, such that 
\f3\fs18 center[0]
\f4\fs20  provides the 
\f1\i x
\f4\i0 -coordinate and 
\f3\fs18 center[1]
\f4\fs20  provides the 
\f1\i y
\f4\i0 -coordinate.  The square central area of the Population Visualization occupies scaled coordinates in [0,1] for both 
\f1\i x
\f4\i0  and 
\f1\i y
\f4\i0 , so the values in 
\f3\fs18 center
\f4\fs20  must be within those bounds.  If a value of 
\f3\fs18 NULL
\f4\fs20  is provided, SLiMgui\'92s default center will be used (which currently arranges subpopulations in a circle).\
The 
\f3\fs18 scale
\f4\fs20  parameter sets a scaling factor to be applied to the radius of the subpopulation\'92s displayed circle.  The default radius used by SLiMgui is a function of the subpopulation\'92s number of individuals; this default radius is then multiplied by 
\f3\fs18 scale
\f4\fs20 .  If a value of 
\f3\fs18 NULL
\f4\fs20  is provided, the default radius will be used; this is equivalent to supplying a 
\f3\fs18 scale
\f4\fs20  of 
\f3\fs18 1.0
\f4\fs20 .  Typically the same 
\f3\fs18 scale
\f4\fs20  value should be used by all subpopulations, to scale all of their circles up or down uniformly, but that is not required.\
The 
\f3\fs18 color
\f4\fs20  parameter sets the color to be used for the displayed subpopulation\'92s circle.  Colors may be specified by name, or with hexadecimal RGB values of the form 
\f3\fs18 "#RRGGBB"
\f4\fs20  (see the Eidos manual).  If 
\f3\fs18 color
\f4\fs20  is

\f3\fs18 initializeSLiMOptions()
\f4\fs20 .  Spatiality 
\f3\fs18 "x"
\f4\fs20  is permitted for dimensionality

\f4\fs20 , or 
\f3\fs18 "xyz"
\f4\fs20  for dimensionality 
\f3\fs18 "xyz"
\f4\fs20 .  The spatial map is defined by a grid of values of a size specified by 
\f3\fs18 gridSize
\f4\fs20 , which must have one value per spatial dimension (or 
\f3\fs18 gridSize
\f4\fs20  may be 
\f3\fs18 NULL
\f4\fs20 ; see below); for a spatiality of 
\f3\fs18 "xz"
\f4\fs20 , for example, 
\f3\fs18 gridSize
\f4\fs20  must be of length 
\f3\fs18 2
\f4\fs20 , specifying the size of the values grid in the 
\f1\i x
\f4\i0  and 
\f1\i z
\f4\i0  dimensions.  The parameter 
\f3\fs18 values
\f4\fs20  then gives the values of the grid; it must be of length equal to the product of the 
\f3\fs18 gridSize
\f4\fs20  elements, and specifies values varying first (i.e., fastest) in the 
\f1\i x
\f4\i0  dimension, then in 
\f1\i y
\f4\i0 , then in 
\f1\i z
\f4\i0 .\
Beginning in SLiM 2.6, the 
\f3\fs18 values
\f4\fs20  parameter may be a matrix/array with the number of dimensions appropriate for the declared spatiality of the map; for example, a map with spatiality 
\f3\fs18 "xy"
\f4\fs20  would require a (two-dimensional) matrix, whereas a map with spatiality of 
\f3\fs18 "xyz"
\f4\fs20  would require a three-dimensional array.  (See the Eidos manual for discussion of matrices and arrays.)  If a matrix/array argument is supplied for 
\f3\fs18 values
\f4\fs20 , 
\f3\fs18 gridSize
\f4\fs20  must either be 
\f3\fs18 NULL
\f4\fs20 , or (for backward compatibility) may match the dimensions of 
\f3\fs18 values
\f4\fs20  as they would be given by 
\f3\fs18 dim(values)
\f4\fs20 .  The data in 
\f3\fs18 values
\f4\fs20  is interpreted just as is described above for the vector case: varying first in 
\f1\i x
\f4\i0 , then in 
\f1\i y
\f4\i0 , then in 
\f1\i z
\f4\i0 .  BEWARE: since the values in Eidos matrices and arrays are stored in column-first order (following the convention established by R), this means that for a map with spatiality 
\f3\fs18 "xy"
\f4\fs20  each column of the 
\f3\fs18 values
\f4\fs20  matrix will provide map data as 
\f1\i x
\f4\i0  varies and 
\f1\i y
\f4\i0  remains constant.  This will be confusing if you think of matrix columns as being \'93
\f1\i x
\f4\i0 \'94 and matrix rows as being \'93
\f1\i y
\f4\i0 \'94, so try not to think that way; the opposite is true.  This behavior is actually simple, self-consistent, and backward-compatible; if you before created a spatial map with a vector 
\f3\fs18 values
\f4\fs20  before and a 
\f3\fs18 gridSize
\f4\fs20  of 
\f3\fs18 c(x, y)
\f4\fs20  specifying the dimensions of that vector, you can now supply 
\f3\fs18 matrix(values, nrow=x)
\f4\fs20  for 
\f3\fs18 values
\f4\fs20  to get exactly the same spatial map, and you can still supply the same value of 
\f3\fs18 c(x, y)
\f4\fs20  for 
\f3\fs18 gridSize
\f4\fs20  if you wish (or you may supply 
\f3\fs18 NULL
\f4\fs20 ).  If, however, you are looking at a matrix as printed in the Eidos console, and want that matrix to be used as a spatial map in SLiM in the same orientation, you should use the transpose of the matrix, as supplied by the 
\f3\fs18 t()
\f4\fs20  function.  Actually, since matrices are printed in the console with each successive row having a 
\f1\i larger
\f4\i0  index, whereas in Cartesian (
\f1\i x
\f4\i0 , 
\f1\i y
\f4\i0 ) coordinates 
\f1\i y
\f4\i0 -values increase as you go 
\f1\i upward
\f4\i0 , you may also wish to reverse the order of rows in your matrix prior to transposing (or the order of columns after transposing), with an expression such as 
\f3\fs18 t(map[(nrow(map)-1):0,])
\f4\fs20 , in order to make the spatial map display in SLiMgui as you expect (since SLiMgui displays everything in Cartesian coordinates).  Apologies if this is confusing; it would be nice if matrix notation, programming languages, and Descartes all agreed on such things, but they do not, so be very careful that your spatial maps are oriented as you wish them to be!\
Moving on to the other parameters of 
\f3\fs18 defineSpatialMap()
\f4\fs20 : if 
\f3\fs18 interpolate
\f4\fs20  is 
\f3\fs18 F
\f4\fs20 , values across the spatial map are not interpolated; the value at a given point is equal to the nearest value defined by the grid of values specified.  If 
\f3\fs18 interpolate
\f4\fs20  is 
\f3\fs18 T
\f4\fs20 , values across the spatial map will be interpolated (using linear, bilinear, or trilinear interpolation as appropriate) to produce spatially continuous variation in values.  In either case, the corners of the value grid are exactly aligned with the corners of the spatial boundaries of the subpopulation as specified by 
\f3\fs18 setSpatialBoundary()
\f4\fs20 , and the value grid is then stretched across the spatial extent of the subpopulation in such a manner as to produce equal spacing between the values along each dimension.  The setting of 
\f3\fs18 interpolation
\f4\fs20  only affects how values between these grid points are calculated: by nearest-neighbor, or by linear interpolation.  Interpolation of spatial maps with periodic boundaries is not handled specially; to ensure that the edges of a periodic spatial map join smoothly, simply ensure that the grid values at the edges of the map are identical, since they will be coincident after periodic wrapping.\
The 
\f3\fs18 valueRange
\f4\fs20  and 
\f3\fs18 colors
\f4\fs20  parameters travel together; either both are unspecified, or both are specified.  They control how map values will be transformed into colors, by SLiMgui and by the 
\f3\fs18 spatialMapColor()
\f4\fs20  method.  The 
\f3\fs18 valueRange
\f4\fs20  parameter establishes the color-mapped range of spatial map values, as a vector of length two specifying a minimum and maximum; this does not need to match the actual range of values in the map.  The 
\f3\fs18 colors
\f4\fs20  parameter then establishes the corresponding colors for values within the interval defined by 
\f3\fs18 valueRange
\f4\fs20 : values less than or equal to 
\f3\fs18 valueRange[0]
\f4\fs20  will map to 
\f3\fs18 colors[0]
\f4\fs20 , values greater than or equal to 
\f3\fs18 valueRange[1]
\f4\fs20  will map to the last 
\f3\fs18 colors
\f4\fs20  value, and intermediate values will shade continuously through the specified vector of colors, with interpolation between adjacent colors to produce a continuous spectrum.  This is much simpler than it sounds in this description; see example recipes for an illustration of its use.\
Note that at present, SLiMgui will only display spatial maps of spatiality 
\f3\fs18 "x"
\f4\fs20 , 
\f3\fs18 "y"
\f4\fs20 , or 
\f3\fs18 "xy"
\f4\fs20 ; the color-mapping parameters will simply be ignored by SLiMgui for other spatiality values (even if the spatiality is a superset of these values; SLiMgui will not attempt to display an 
\f3\fs18 "xyz"
\f4\fs20  spatial map, for example, since it has no way to choose which 2D slice through the 
\f1\i xyz
\f4\i0  space it ought to display).  The 
\f3\fs18 spatialMapColor()
\f4\fs20  method will return translated color strings for any spatial map, however, even if SLiMgui is unable to display the spatial map.  If there are multiple spatial maps with color-mapping parameters defined, SLiMgui will choose just one for display; it will prefer an 
\f3\fs18 "xy"
\f4\fs20  map if one is available, but beyond that heuristic its choice will be arbitrary.\

\f3\fs18 Mutation
\f4\fs20  and 
\f3\fs18 Substitution
\f4\fs20  presently are (see the Eidos manual\'92s documentation for 
\f3\fs18 defineConstant()
\f4\fs20  for further discussion).  \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
This dictionary-style functionality is actually provided by the superclass of 
\f3\fs18 Substitution
\f4\fs20 , 
\f3\fs18 \cf0 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 EidosDictionary
\f4\fs20 \cf2 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
, although that fact is not presently visible in Eidos since superclasses are not introspectable.\

These recipes are all taken directly from SLiM's manual:

Haller, B.C., and Messer, P.W. (2016). SLiM: An Evolutionary Simulation Framework.

SLiM's manual contains full explanations of each recipe, in the corresponding section; please refer to it for further information.  These recipes are provided as separate files for convenience, particularly since copy-paste from the PDF manual often works poorly (but note that SLiMgui now allows you to open these recipes directly from the File menu, also, via the Open Recipe submenu).

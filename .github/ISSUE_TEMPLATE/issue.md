Hi!  Please don't ask questions about how to use SLiM on GitHub; instead, please go to the slim-discuss mailing list at https://groups.google.com/g/slim-discuss.  If you have a bug report or feature request, on the other hand, you have found the right place.  Please provide any information that will allow us to reproduce the bug, including a complete SLiM script (if appropriate) that is self-contained, with all defined constants set up in script rather than needing to be passed on the command line.  If the script requires any external files to run, please attach those too, or provide a link to where they can be downloaded.

For more guidance on how to file a good bug report, you might read "Ten simple rules for reporting a bug" (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010540).

Incidentally, if you are a new SLiM user and have not yet done the SLiM Workshop, it is highly recommended to get through the initial learning curve.  It is available for free online at http://benhaller.com/workshops/workshops.html.

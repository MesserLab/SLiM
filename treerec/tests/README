To add a new test:

1. Put the recipe in the `testRecipes/` directory, with a filename like `test_XXX.slim`.
2. Add the additional necessary stuff:

    a. To check that haplotypes agree between SLiM and the tree sequence, just put
        ```
        source("testing_utils.slim");
        ```
        in `initialize()` (this calls `InitializeTreeSequence()` and defines functions);
        and then call
        ```
        outputMutationResult();
        ```
        at the end (well, whenever you want, really; but only once).

    b. To mark individuals in the initial generation with particular mutation types
        so we can check *something* even with mutation recording turned off, do
        ```
        source("marked_mutations_setup.slim");
        ```
        in `initialize()`, and then
        ```
        initializeMarks(n_marks);
        ```
        in `1` (after adding the subpop), and then
        ```
        outputMutationTypes();
        ```
        at the end. Note that this will only work properly if there is no new mutation.

    c. Add `chooseAncestralSamples(5)` to some generations along the way
        to add some individuals as "ancestral samples".

To temporarily turn off a test, just add e.g. `dont_` to the start of its file name.
Or, add it to `failingTestRecipes/`.

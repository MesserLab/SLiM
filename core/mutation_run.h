 The class MutationRun represents a run of mutations inside a genome.  It is used internally by Genome; it is not visible to Eidos
 code in SLiM, since the Genome class hides it behind a simplified API.  Most clients of Genome should strive to use the Genome
 APIs directly; it would be nice if MutationRun could be kept as a private implementation detail in most (all?) cases.

#if SLIM_USE_NONNEUTRAL_CACHES
	
	// Non-neutral mutation caching.  This is a somewhat complex scheme designed to speed up fitness calculations.
	// The idea is that the mutation run can cache, once, a list of all of the non-neutral mutations it contains,
	// and then the fitness code can refer to that cached list from then on, saving a huge amount of looping over
	// neutral mutations in many simulations.  This simple idea is complicated by a few factors.  First of all, if
	// the mutation run changes, the cache needs to be invalidated.  Second, if the external information that the
	// cache relies upon changes, the cache needs to be invalidated.  That external information consists of (a) the
	// selection coefficients of mutations, and (b) the existence and state of fitness() callbacks.  There are
	// three separate regimes in which these caches are used:
	//
	//	1. No fitness callbacks defined.  Here caches depend solely upon mutation selection coefficients, and can
	//		be carried forward through generations with impunity.  If any mutation's selcoeff is changed between
	//		zero and non-zero, a global flag in SLiMSim (nonneutral_change_counter_) marks all caches as invalid.
	//
	//	2. Only constant-effect neutral callbacks are defined: "return 0.0;".  RecalculateFitness() runs through
	//		mutation types and callbacks, and figures this state out and sets a flag in each mutation type as to
	//		whether it is effectively neutral, after considering these constant-effect callbacks, or not.  This
	//		state changes in every generation, so caches cannot be carried forward from generation to generation
	//		in this regime unless the state of the callbacks, with respect to making mutation types neutral, is
	//		unchanged.  If RecalculateFitness() detects a callback change, it sets the global all-invalid flag.
	//
	//	3. At least one non-constant callback is defined.  RecalculateFitness() figures this out, and if this is
	//		the case, the non-neutral cache must include all mutations for which their muttype has a callback
	//		defined at all, whether constant or not, neutral or not, active or not, because the callback regime
	//		itself could change unpredictably.  These caches cannot be carried forward unless the state of the
	//		callbacks, with respect to which mutation types are influenced by them, is unchanged.  If a callback
	//		change is detected by RecalculateFitness(), it sets the global all-invalid flag.
	//
	//	(FIXME) One could imagine inserting a regime between 2 and 3 that would allow a mix of constant and
	//		non-constant callbacks, as long as the non-constant callbacks were "well-behaved" – no use of the
	//		active property, no executeLambda, etc. – so that SLiM could know that the constant callbacks would
	//		apply if they were active.  This could be pretty useful for models that have a mix of QTLs (using
	//		a constant neutral callbacks) and other loci that are governed by fitness callbacks.  This strikes
	//		me as a pretty edge case, though; mostly models are either QTL models or non-QTL models, I think.
	//
	// When models switch between one regime and another, they generally need to recache, since the criteria
	// for inclusion in the cache differs from regime to regime.  This is handled by RecalculateFitness().
	// The last regime used (for the previous generation) is remembered in sim.last_nonneutral_regime_.
	//
	// Mutation runs are considered to be immutable in SLiM if they are referred to by more than one genome.
	// If they are referred to only once, however, they can be changed.  What that occurs, their nonneutral
	// cache must be invalidated.  This means that any code that calls UseCount() on a mutrun, and modifies it
	// if the count is 1, must also invalidate the nonneutral cache.  This is done automatically by the existing
	// methods – in particular, MutationRun::will_modify_run(), which should be a funnel for all such code.
	// Newly created mutation runs are also routinely modified on the (valid) assumption that they are referred
	// to by only one genome (or no genomes at all, more likely); this is fine since they don't have a nonneutral
	// cache yet anyway.
	//
	// These caches are only used for mutation runs that are accessed by the FitnessOfParentWithGenomeIndices...()
	// suite of methods; pure neutral models and non-chromosome-dependent models will never touch these caches
	// and the buffer will never be allocated.

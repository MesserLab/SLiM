 The class MutationType represents a type of mutation defined in the input file, such as a synonymous mutation or an adaptive mutation.
 A particular mutation type is defined by its distribution of fitness effects (DFE) and its dominance coefficient.  Once a mutation type
 is defined, a draw from its DFE can be generated to determine the selection coefficient of a particular mutation of that type.

// This include is up here because I had to jump through some hoops to break a #include loop between this and mutation_run.h;
// forward declaration wasn't enough, because MutationType includes a MutationRun inside itself now, and mutation_run.h defines
// an inline function that uses MutationType in a concrete fashion, so the mutual dependency was harder to break.

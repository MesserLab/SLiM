<p align="justify">
	SLiM is an evolutionary simulation framework that combines a powerful engine for population genetic simulations with the capability of modeling arbitrarily complex evolutionary scenarios. Simulations are configured via the integrated Eidos scripting language that allows interactive control over practically every aspect of the simulated scenarios. The underlying individual-based simulation engine is highly optimized to enable modeling of entire chromosomes in large populations. We also provide a graphical user interface called SLiMgui on macOS, Linux, and Windows for easy simulation set-up, interactive runtime control, and dynamic visualization of simulation output.

Development & Feedback
-----------------------------------

SLiM is under active development, and our goal is to make it as broadly useful as possible.  If you have feedback or feature requests, or if you are interested in contributing to SLiM, please contact Philipp Messer at [messer@cornell.edu](mailto:messer@cornell.edu). Please note that Philipp is also looking for graduate students and postdocs.

Installation
------------
<em>Looking for Binary Packages / Installers?</em>

The following subsections summarize what methods for acquiring SLiM (and SLiMgui) are available.  Building from sources is also an option on all platforms; see the next section.  Chapter 2 of the SLiM manual contains much more detail on installation and building of SLiM.  The manual and other SLiM resources can be found at [http://messerlab.org/slim/](http://messerlab.org/slim/#Downloads).

##### macOS
Download and double-click the macOS Installer from the SLiM home page at https://messerlab.org/slim/#Downloads.  It will install the `slim` and `eidos` command-line tools, as well as SLiMgui.

##### Linux
###### Arch & Manjaro
Any Arch-based distributions *which support the AUR* should be compatible.

https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/slim-simulator/

###### Fedora, Red Hat, openSUSE
Derivative distributions are not guaranteed compatibility with these binary packages. Enable the repository for your operating system; you might also try using the source RPM package to rebuild the package for your system to give you an excellent integration for any RPM-based distribution.

https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/bacarson/SLiM-Selection_on_Linked_Mutations/

###### Debian & Ubuntu (and any derivatives using dpkg)
A shell script using the facilities of `dpkg` is available. It uses the CMake install target to integrate SLiMgui with the desktop environment. It has the advantage over building from source that it will check build dependencies for you, and it will automatically remove build artifacts from `/tmp`. Source the script with `curl` following the instructions in the manual.

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MesserLab/SLiM-Extras/master/installation/DebianUbuntuInstall.sh

##### Windows (10 & 11)
###### Native package (using MSYS2)
If you have MSYS2 installed, you can do `pacman -Syu` to update its information (see the SLiM manual for further information).  You can then install SLiM and SLiMgui with:

`pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-slim-simulator`

###### WSL2 installation guide
The SLiM manual provides detailed instructions on building and installing SLiM and SLiMgui under the WSL2.



Compilation of SLiM from Source
----------------------------------

You can build both SLiM and SLiMgui from sources.  This can be useful, in particular, if you wish to run a recent development version of SLiM, rather than the last released version.  See chapter 2 of the SLiM manual for more information on building from sources on various platforms.
